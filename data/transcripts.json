There are many proofs that shows how kamas is looting the food and taking it and putting it in storage in their own underground facilities. So guys, we have been hearing a lot about reports that the IDF and Israel is starving the Gazna population in the Gaza Strip. So today we decided to go boots on the ground into Gaza into crossway from which the humanitarian trucks are entering Gaza from Israel to see what really is happening on the ground. It's going to be a long drive. It's around 2 hours from Jerusalem and it's going to be very hot. So, I'm taking some water, helmet, bulletproof vest, Bible I always have with me, and of course, boots. But first, make sure to like, share, and subscribe. And I even stopped my car on the side of the world to help you hit that subscribe button. Okay. [Music] What really is annoying about this situation is that basically no matter how much help and humanitarian aid Israel is providing the Gaza population, the international media is spreading lies and deceit that reaches more and more people around the world with false information than with the truth. Sadly, this is what's going on because the enemies of Israel, Iran, Qatar, and other countries are investing a lot a lot of finances in order to spread false propaganda against what's happening in the Gaza Strip. [Music] So guys, a little bit of off-road driving here and we made it into the Gaza Israel border. And I see the bord of friends. Okay, we've made it. It sure is crazy hot here. [Music] Ready to go. [Music] So guys, we just arrived at the location and behind me here is one of the humanitarian aid trucks that are delivering the food after it crosses into the Gaza side of the border. So you have to see, look at all the metal and the barb wire and the glasses of this truck because the moment it enters Gaza, it is immediately looted by the Palestinians that want the food all by Hamas themselves. So it needs to be protected. This looks like a scene from MadMax or something like that. Just crazy, really crazy situation. Here we are now entering into the Gaza Strip to see what humanitarian aid is actually reaches. But what we have been seeing in the last few weeks is that the international media keeps you know proclaiming this statement that Israel is starving the Gaza population. Is that true? Is there any merit to that? Where do we receive these reports from? No. The allegations of deliberate starvation are complete When we go into the Gaza Strip now, we're going to see not only the humanitarian aid that Israel is letting in, but also the catastrophic failure of the United Nations to distribute that aid. We're going to see the contents of hundreds of trucks rotting in the sun because the UN has not been able to shift it and get it to the people who need it and make sure Hamas can't steal it. And unfortunately, instead of taking responsibility and scaling up their operations and taking certain risks in a war zone, they find it much easier to blame Israel because they've been doing what they've been doing since the very beginning of the war, trying to pressure Israel to end the war with the Hamas regime still in power in Gaza, free to plot another October 7th massacre, and free to catch its breath for the next war. Well, which is what they're doing. Why is the humanitarian aid so important for Hamas? Humanitarian aid is important because it is Hamas's main financial lifeline. It's international sources of funding have in large part been cut off and it's been able to make money by taxing the goods that go into Gaza. Whatever goes selling at very inflated prices to the population or when the merchants sell them at inflated prices, you go around with a gun to the merchant and say, \"Give me thousands of dollars.\" Yeah. And and so Hamas operates as a protection. Uh so the the goods going into Gaza have enabled Hamas to sustain its governance structure inside the Gaza Strip and its control over the population. That's why what Israel tries to do with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is to separate Hamas from the civilian population and make sure aid can get to the people who need it and bypass the Hamas system and Hamas's ability to infiltrate the broken UN system. But you know, the Gaza Strip now is the most complicated humanitarian challenge in military history because there's nowhere else in the world where the UN is expected to deliver aid inside an active combat zone controlled by the enemy. Normally, civilians are moved out of harm's way, and you give them aid somewhere safe. But here, Egypt shut the border for more than the last year. It won't let any aid at all through the Rafa crossing. Civilians aren't allowed to leave. And so you have the challenge of how to get aid to people who need it when Hamas is hiding in tunnels under their feet and trying to get its hands on whatever it can. Yeah. No, it's it's a very terrible situation. But are any other countries delivering aid to their enemies during a war? It's not something that happens. International law says that countries have an obligation to facilitate aid to the enemy population as long as there's no evidence that it's going to support the enemy's army. And here it is going to support the enemy's military. and Israel is still allowing that aid to reach the people who need it, of course. Well, thank you so much. Let's see what's going to happen inside. Okay, let's have a look inside. So, we are now inside the Gaza Strip. I'm here at the humanitarian aid corridor in Gaza, just a few minutes from the Israeli border, right next to the Kum Shalom border crossing. This is one of the main gateways where food, water, and medicine enter into the Gaza Strip. Aid comes through in two ways. By trucks, hundreds of them every week. And now, for the first time in this war, by air. Over the weekend, Israeli planes dropped pallets of humanitarian aid straight into Gaza. I'm talking about flour, sugar, canned food, the basics. The big question that the world keeps asking is this. Are people in Gaza starving? And if so, who is responsible? So, first, let's be clear. The humanitarian situation in Gaza is very serious. People are struggling. That's what's happens in this war and in a war in general. And make no mistakes, there is a war going on just kilometers from where I'm standing now. And the IDF is fighting Hamas terrorists in seven areas across the Gaza Strip in Canunes, in the south, in Gaza City, in the north. Combat brigades are going after tunnels, weapon sites, and Hamas fighters. A war zone in the Gaza Strip being under fire by Hamas terrorist. You don't have time to sit and drink your coffee and wake up in the morning and get ready for the day and prepare. So sometimes I woke up at two in the morning after an hour and a half of sleep and you need to wake up immediately and do your job and do it to perfection or people die. You literally have your life on the line. You don't know what corner you turn and somebody's got a gun pointed at you. So in order to wake up, I just took a vignia pill and I really felt the energy levels go up faster. The clarity of mine that doesn't usually happen immediately when you wake up in the morning. And I don't remember taking much stuff with me into the Gaza Strip. Had my sleeping bag, a flashlight, and the vignia bottle. So that that's what I had with me. You're a young person. You're very healthy, but you still think that Vineia was helpful to get you to even a higher level of performance. It's helping me to exceed my normal abilities. So, let's say, you know, I'm at 100% and that puts me at 120. With raising three kids, you need to be sharp and make the right decisions. Raising three kids may be equal to combat. A lot harder. A lot harder. Listen, I'm still taking Vignia every day because I want to be there with my kids when they grow old. I want to be able to dance at their wedding and carry my kids and my grandkids for years to come. And this is the time to start. I mean, when you're young with all that is happening, how is aid still getting in? This past week alone, more than 258 trucks were allowed into the Gaza through the crossings just like this one. Another 600 trucks worth of, you know, food, water, and medicine were distributed by the United Nations and other aid groups inside Gaza. Israel also just began airdropping humanitarian aid. Seven pallets went in over the weekend flown in by the Israeli Air Force. On top of that, Israel has opened humanitarian corridors designated safe routes inside Gaza where the United Nations aid convoys can pass without being caught in the crossfire of this fighting. These are carefully coordinated zones and times also that have windows where the IDF pauses its combat operations in its activity to allow the movement of trucks, supplies, and even civilians in these areas. Israel also declares temporarily that humanitarian pauses will take effect hours each day, often between the morning and the late afternoon where military action is halted in specific zones with high civilian populations. This is meant to give the people a chance to access the food, the water, the medical care, and the aid workers to operate more freely and safely to bring the food to those who need it. Israel also reconnected an imported electrical power line in the southern dissalination plant inside Gaza. That plant is now producing 10 times more clean water than before. And all of this is happening while the war continues. Israeli soldiers are under fire and still the state is working to get aid into Gaza. But here's where things get complicated. Israel says it's not responsible for distribution of the aid inside the Gaza Strip. Once the trucks pass through Kim Shalom or other border crossings, it's up to the United Nations and the international organizations to collect it and give it to the people. And that's where things start to break down. Not just because of logistics, but because of the Hamas terrorists. Israel says there is no famine in Gaza. And if people are starving, it's not because Israel isn't letting food in. It's because Hamas is taking their food and are stealing it to the civilian population at a highly inflated price. Hamas is known for stealing the aid and hiding it inside tunnels or selling it for profit. They've done this before and they've recently did it as well. and the IDF released footage of Hamas fighters feasting underground in tunnels while children above the ground in Gaza struggle to find food. The reality is that Hamas doesn't care if their own people go hungry. In fact, the worse things get for the Palestinian people, the more the world sees the pain and the suffering, the better it is for Hamas's strategy. And once again, they're using their own civilians as a weapon. as a shield, as PR against Israel. So, Israel says it's doing everything it can to avoid hurting the innocent people of the Gaza Strip, even while fighting a brutal enemy, Hamas. And on the other hand, the Palestinian terrorist organization is doing the opposite. They hide in hospitals. They launch rockets from schools. They steal weapons on their homes and stole them inside children's cribs. And now they're using starvation as a story, a headline to turn the world against Israel. Let's go take a look at what really is happening. I'm standing here in the middle of a humanitarian aid distribution center inside the Gaza Strip. So the aid trucks reach Kam Shalom from the Israeli side of the border and then they dump all the humanitarian aid, all the goods, the flower here. The IDF is making sure that there is no weapons, no bombs, no ammunitions, nothing here. And then the United Nations trucks are supposed to take this goods and deliver it to the Palestinian people inside the Gaza Strip. But they haven't been doing that. And all this aid has been sitting here. Tons and tons and tons of humanitarian aid has been sitting here to rot in the sun. And I can tell you it is boiling hot in here. So, is Israel starving the Palestinian people or is it the United Nations or is it Hamas? Let me know what you think in the comments, guys. We are here at the Gazan side of the Kum Shalom crossing. Now, it's important for me to emphasize here as the representative of the IDF, we are not starving anyone. This is not an aim. This is not a war goal for us. We are fighting kamas vicious kamas is fighting his own people. You already know that he's using his population as human shield cynically. He's using them in order to u create this campaign of starvation against Israel against the IDF. This is a war zone for over 21 months now. It's a war that was imposed on us. We didn't selected this war. We didn't want to open this war. They opened it. Now they are using starvation as a tool of war against us. It's a strategic weapon in their hands. It's very sad. Now if it's because of any reason, security reason, we offered the UN already several times to support it. But they uh refused to that. Now we are improving this effort regardless of kamas efforts to stop it. We will push it as hard as we can, including air drops of food by us and by other foreign countries, including opening humanitarian corridors, secured humanitarian corridors temporarily in certain times, in certain areas in order to hand food directly to the people of Gaza without kamas looting it. Now, we have to understand and we have to remember, I also saw this fake news in the last few days all over the media. There are many proofs. You already seen that video clips, recordings from phone conversations between kamas people and themselves. Uh enough proofs that shows how kamas is looting the food and taking it and putting it in as a in storage in their own underground facilities and in their warehouses and stopping the the food from the population of Gaza. There is food in Gaza right now as we speak, but it is in the wrong hands. We will continue to push uh as hard as we can to feed the people of Gaza on one hand. On the other hand, we will keep fighting Kamas as hard as we can in order to dismantle kamas. Kamas cannot control the Gaza strip the day after. We cannot allow October 7th happen again. This massacre again. We won't allow it. This is our mission. And most important than all, we still have 50 hostages captive brutally in the hands of Gaza in the underground facilities. They are being tortured as we speak now. And we will do our best in order to free them and bring them home, dead and alive alike. Thank you very much. So, back in Israel, we just finished full day of recording inside the Gaza Strip, not far from the border in the humanitarian area where the food is being brought from Israel into the Gazan side. And then in there, the United Nations trucks should get it into the hands of the Palestinian people, hopefully without Hamas stealing it. And guys, now you can be the judge and you can answer the question. Is Israel really starving the Gazam population or not? Let me know in the comments what you think.

yourself for the perfect [01:23.9] entry into that wave subsequently you [01:27.4] find yourself taking off light under the [01:29.6] lip the wave breaking on you angling in [01:33.1] the opposite direction that you should [01:34.8] or missing it all together if this is [01:37.7] you say I a much smarter strategy is to [01:41.7] position yourself a little further in [01:44.4] than you think you need to so that you [01:47.3] can face the wave as long as possible [01:49.5] whilst it comes to you now that mightn't [01:52.3] always be an option if you're in the [01:54.4] ocean where waves shift and move but one [01:57.7] way that you can adjust your position [01:59.5] with still being able to look at the [02:02.3] wave is by doing it on a 45 degree angle [02:05.9] either out towards the way it towards [02:08.6] the ocean or in towards the beach [02:10.6] basically all of these directions here [02:14.3] but not the Direction behind you which [02:16.9] would require you to turn your back to [02:18.8] the wave [02:25.6] more Success reading waves means more [02:28.2] success catching waves more success [02:30.7] catching waves means more time spent [02:33.5] riding waves and that means progressing [02:36.5] faster out of the beginner category [02:39.1] number two you keep surfing out into the [02:42.6] flats this is a big problem this part of [02:45.3] the wave here that we're looking at is [02:46.9] the power Zone and basically if you look [02:49.4] at a wave it increases in speed [02:52.4] potential the higher up you go out here [02:55.3] is what we call the flats no [02:56.7] gravitational or power potential if we [02:59.4] surf out there we're going to lose speed [03:01.0] if we lose speed that means we're not [03:02.5] going to have any control if we don't [03:04.1] have control then we can't work on our [03:06.1] technique as we pop up we want to think [03:08.3] about getting us and our surfboard back [03:11.4] up to the top third of the wave face [03:13.8] whether that be for a maneuver or [03:16.1] something more relevant for beginners [03:17.5] just to start generating speed now to do [03:21.3] that I want you to actually look up to [03:24.2] the top part of the wave as you're [03:27.2] paddling in you can check in with your [03:28.7] surfboard look down the line check in [03:30.4] with your surfboard look down the line [03:31.6] once your feet hit the deck of the board [03:34.0] that's your cue to look up to the top [03:37.1] and also point there with your leading [03:39.9] arm [03:43.4] now if we take too long to pop up or our [03:46.7] eyes and this is probably the most [03:48.4] common problem that I see never leave [03:50.5] the front of the surfboard angled out [03:52.4] toward the beach you'll never actually [03:54.4] change directions and you'll simply surf [03:56.6] straight forward down the wave into the [03:59.9] flats lose speed be sucked back up the [04:02.8] wave and then dumped with the lip [04:05.0] needless to say this really restricts [04:07.4] any sort of progression that might ensue [04:09.7] on the wave face because we never [04:11.4] actually quite get there the [04:13.3] prescription for this once your feet hit [04:15.4] the deck of the surfboard look and point [04:17.9] up to the top third of the wave and then [04:19.9] think about jumping up there alright the [04:22.9] third reason you're stuck as a beginner [04:24.8] Surfer is because you refuse or don't [04:27.9] have the confidence to Surf waves big [04:30.7] enough [04:31.7] to do Maneuvers this is an interesting [04:34.3] one and yet quite common many Surfers [04:37.6] simply don't have the confidence to [04:39.2] tackle waves that are slightly out of [04:41.3] their comfort zone and yet it's these [04:42.9] very ways that offer the speed and the [04:46.1] space to start learning to do Maneuvers [04:49.0] we're approaching the inflection point [04:50.7] at which beginner Surfers can become [04:52.3] intermediate Surfers here so it's a [04:54.5] really important step essentially they [04:56.2] move from cutting across the way face [04:58.5] learning speed flow to trying Maneuvers [05:01.4] now without enough space on the wave [05:04.1] Maneuvers become quite difficult [05:06.2] especially when surfing larger boards [05:09.0] like this without enough speed as well [05:12.2] Maneuvers are harder to commit to [05:13.8] because forward momentum or gyroscopic [05:17.2] stability as it's called creates a more [05:20.0] stable Surfer it's just like riding a [05:22.0] bike when you try and turn a corner [05:23.6] without moving fast enough you kind of [05:25.9] just tip and fall over it's the same [05:27.6] thing on a surfboard we need speed to [05:29.5] keep us stable and strong so we need to [05:31.7] look at why beginner Surfers are lacking [05:33.9] confidence here and this is where some [05:36.2] wave catching assistance becomes a big [05:38.9] game changer when I'm coaching services [05:40.9] at the pool I I sometimes offer them [05:42.8] three to four even even more pushes [05:46.0] assisted pushes into wave simply to help [05:48.5] the surfer [05:49.7] ascertain some sort of kinesthetic [05:52.9] awareness around entering the wave with [05:56.2] an appropriate appropriate amount of [05:58.1] speed and in the right position [06:00.7] and sometimes it's just this little [06:02.6] propping up that completely changes a [06:05.3] surface confidence because they now know [06:07.3] how hard they have to paddle and from [06:10.6] where to catch the wave it's basically [06:13.1] just giving them a short-term prop up so [06:16.3] that they can learn the confidence by [06:18.9] feeling it and then recreate that on [06:21.4] their own if you don't have anyone who [06:23.4] can assist you in catching a wave simply [06:25.7] go out in waves that are slightly out of [06:28.0] your comfort zone and just observe more [06:30.2] advanced Surfers than you where do they [06:31.8] sit how hard do they paddle where are [06:33.9] they in relation to the lip see if you [06:35.9] can start to copy that or at the very [06:38.5] least start to visualize yourself doing [06:40.7] that [06:44.8] and remember you can always use my old [06:47.6] trick three two one go [06:50.3] and finally number four it's surfing [06:52.6] from the hips instead of the knees this [06:55.7] is what we might term sub optimal [06:58.3] loading and it's when a surfer can't [07:01.5] distinguish between compressing into [07:03.4] their legs which is optimal with hinging [07:06.4] at the hips which is sub-optimal now the [07:09.5] easiest way to describe this is if I [07:11.6] asked you to jump really high in the air [07:14.0] you would naturally load up into the [07:16.5] legs seen visibly by tightening angle at [07:20.4] the knee joint and a little bit of a [07:22.9] hinge at the hips as well now in surfing [07:25.7] we're using a very similar movement to [07:28.1] extend off the bottom of the wave in our [07:30.0] bottom turn or more relevant for [07:31.4] beginners for our speed flow movements [07:34.7] if the surfer isn't bending at the knees [07:37.1] and only hinging at the hips they won't [07:38.9] be able to produce enough power to get [07:41.7] back up the wave face with any drive or [07:44.8] speed and like I mentioned earlier it's [07:47.1] this drive or speed that makes Maneuvers [07:49.4] possible [07:53.0] additionally this position also creates [07:55.1] an awkward weight distribution which [07:56.8] often sees the surfer toppling off to [07:58.6] their toe side rail as they try to pop [08:01.3] up the prescription here once again is [08:03.3] to put your body into the coiled spring [08:05.9] position the active compression where [08:08.3] your knees are bent [08:10.3] about to extend or jump if you will up [08:14.3] the wave face [08:16.1] well that's it for me those are four [08:18.2] reasons why you're still stuck in the [08:20.2] beginner phase of Surfing and for [08:23.0] solutions for you to pass through the [08:25.9] beginner phase of Surfing this is all [08:27.9] based on my beginner surface roadmap uh [08:30.7] it's the curriculum helping thousands of [08:32.8] surfers smash their surfing goals and [08:35.2] progress out of that beginner Zone that [08:37.3] beginner category through to [08:38.6] intermediate so they can start working [08:40.0] on maneuvers you can check that out at [08:42.2] the [08:43.0] surfersroadmap.com and don't forget as [08:45.3] well [08:46.1] I'm running a bunch of Retreats this [08:47.7] year around the world we've got a [08:49.1] handful of spots left and I'd love for [08:51.8] one of you guys to come along to that [08:53.7] that'll be super fun uh join me on [08:56.6] Instagram as well at Kale's broccoli [08:58.6] other than that guys thanks for your [09:00.5] patience on this uh funky little upload [09:03.5] schedule at the moment I will see

    "text": "[00:00.1] I've been surfing for over 20 years now [00:12.4] that surfing is my job I've taken a [00:15.8] particular interest in the science of [00:18.6] learning it and I'm as obsessed with it [00:22.0] as ever [00:23.8] as far as Sports go it's a really tricky [00:26.4] one to progress because the changing [00:29.3] nature of the ocean and waves makes [00:31.6] repetition a little hard to come by but [00:35.2] there are some Surefire ways to [00:37.4] guarantee and fast track your surfing [00:40.0] progress and today I'm going to share [00:42.2] five of them with you because [00:44.1] man I wish I knew about them when I [00:46.6] started [00:48.8] and make sure you stick around to the [00:50.8] end of the video because I'm going to [00:52.3] teach you guys a really helpful training [00:53.9] routine that's going to totally [00:55.1] transform your surfing [01:07.0] this video is brought to you by my [01:08.5] online surfing University the Surfers [01:10.7] roadmap whether it's a structured [01:12.5] surfscape program choosing the right [01:14.5] SURFboard or progressing from beginner [01:16.7] to intermediate we've got you covered [01:18.5] with top quality online courses check it [01:21.5] out via the link in the description [01:22.9] below [01:28.4] number one the fact that you can [01:30.8] progress at any age I think there's a [01:33.4] general conception that as you get older [01:36.1] attaining skills is harder but in [01:39.7] surfing I found that this is not quite [01:42.4] the case you can progress just as fast [01:44.5] in your mid-20s mid 30s mid 40s with the [01:47.6] right approach and that is probably key [01:50.5] the right approach there are three main [01:52.3] factors to get this right and number one [01:53.9] is mindset science shows pretty clearly [01:56.6] that if you have the belief that you can [01:59.3] learn something then it's going to have [02:00.8] a major impact on whether you actually [02:03.1] do obviously if you have the confidence [02:04.9] and the belief that you can actually [02:06.9] attain a certain level of Surfing this [02:10.2] means that it becomes more possible for [02:12.9] you to do so and number two frequency of [02:15.8] practice I'm sorry but you probably need [02:18.7] to start surfing more than once a week [02:21.2] if you want to progress [02:22.7] with any sort of uh Pace three is [02:26.3] obviously quality of guidance and input [02:29.2] into your surfing which is literally the [02:32.3] main reason I created the surface [02:34.3] roadmap surface have suffered from a [02:36.8] lack of clarity when it comes to a [02:39.1] step-by-step approach to improving their [02:40.7] surfing so if you believe you can [02:42.7] improve if you commit to serving a lot [02:45.7] or at least as much as you can more than [02:48.5] you probably think you need to and you [02:50.8] actually gain a clear picture of what it [02:53.2] is exactly you're trying to achieve with [02:55.1] your surfing that is you get good [02:56.7] guidance and steps on how to actually [02:59.5] achieve those tangible things then [03:02.6] progression will come at any age number [03:05.3] two that overcoming a fear of ways [03:08.2] actually requires a step-by-step [03:10.5] approach many Surfers when they start to [03:13.1] have a fear of a certain size of wave [03:16.1] now I'm here to tell you that every [03:18.5] Surfer has a fear of a certain size of [03:21.8] wave it's just all relative to their [03:23.9] experience the big mistake here is [03:26.1] presuming that there's something wrong [03:27.5] with you for fearing that wave and maybe [03:30.2] assuming that every other Surfer the [03:32.8] surface that you aspire to be like don't [03:34.9] have a fear of waves and that's simply [03:36.2] not true everybody no matter who you're [03:38.2] looking at has a fear of a certain type [03:40.2] of wave and the main factor here is [03:42.5] their experience their exposure I found [03:44.9] that by gradually exposing yourself to [03:47.6] waves slightly out of your comfort zone [03:49.9] is the best way to deaden and [03:53.2] desensitize yourself to those types of [03:56.1] waves and before you know it actually [03:58.0] happens without you really noticing the [04:00.7] ways that you used to be scared of all [04:02.4] of a sudden and no longer scary to you I [04:05.2] grew up in Adelaide which literally has [04:07.5] no surf it took me almost into my 20s [04:11.1] before I could even fathom surfing away [04:13.4] of over four foot and yet now it's [04:17.4] become a lot more possible and I [04:19.0] actually start to chase those waves and [04:21.5] really enjoy it and the next level up [04:23.8] that scares me is obviously a lot bigger [04:25.9] the way I was able to do that was [04:27.6] through gradual exposure over a number [04:29.8] of years two waves slightly outside my [04:32.9] comfort zone now obviously we don't want [04:34.9] to push you too much because that's [04:36.1] going to cause anxiety if we look at the [04:37.7] science of Flow State we want to [04:40.0] slightly challenge you and then that's [04:42.6] going to eventually bring up your skill [04:44.5] level to be able to match that of the [04:46.8] more intense ways the fear itself never [04:49.4] actually goes away it just takes a [04:51.4] bigger wave to instill it in you now [04:53.7] essentially our yardstick our measuring [04:55.7] device has changed quick tip if being [04:58.9] out in challenging surf with a surfboard [05:01.5] tied to you via a leg rope is a [05:05.0] challenging and scary idea for you which [05:06.8] it is for a lot of people and I [05:08.3] recommend going out and actually [05:09.9] swimming amongst the lineup to start to [05:13.1] develop that confidence and to settle [05:15.8] you in take you out of your head a [05:17.8] little bit obviously you need to be a [05:19.2] good swimmer though number three is that [05:21.9] surfscape training can pretty much [05:25.3] perfect your on-wave Technique [05:28.0] especially if you're an intermediate [05:30.3] server as I mentioned at the start of [05:32.1] this video and surfing repetition is [05:34.1] hard to come by and that's why I've used [05:36.8] surf skates consistently for myself and [05:39.1] my clients to great success over the [05:42.1] years because you can get that [05:44.3] repetition on land in a safe controlled [05:47.6] environment I wish that I knew this when [05:50.1] I was younger because I could have upped [05:51.7] my my game so much quicker but instead [05:55.1] it just took me a really long time the [05:56.6] reason I say this works especially well [05:58.0] for intermediates is because a certain [06:00.7] level of kind aesthetic awareness of [06:02.9] what a wave feels like is a really good [06:05.9] way to inform your online surfscape [06:09.1] training and help you visualize how the [06:13.4] on land techniques correspond to the [06:16.4] on-wave techniques the curriculum that I [06:18.8] developed for the ultimate surfscape [06:20.9] program is built around those [06:22.7] fundamental movements of Surfing so even [06:25.7] if you are a beginner you can use that [06:28.6] to begin to generate that kinesthetic [06:31.9] awareness it's not going to be exactly [06:34.2] the same because obviously waves move [06:35.8] but you can start to inform your on-wave [06:38.6] surfing with the training that you do on [06:42.1] land on the surf skates as well at that [06:44.3] point we have this bi-directional [06:45.9] relationship between what you're doing [06:47.3] out in the water on a wave and what [06:49.0] you're doing on land and we see this [06:50.4] crossover this integration of skills and [06:54.1] skill development that can really fast [06:56.3] track your surfing progress really [06:58.0] important tip when you are implementing [06:59.9] surfscape training make sure you are [07:01.7] visualizing actively a wave when you are [07:05.2] doing it now I'm going to give you a [07:06.3] really helpful exercise at the end of [07:07.7] this video as well number four the right [07:09.9] surfboard now if you're a grommet and [07:12.0] you weigh 30 kilos whatever you can [07:14.5] pretty much get away with you know the [07:16.1] wrong surfboard for for years but if [07:18.1] you're late teens early 20s and beyond [07:20.2] all the way through 50s 60s 70s ladies [07:23.3] then getting the right surfboard is [07:25.7] going to take the pressure off it's [07:27.6] going to remove the bottleneck that can [07:29.8] exist through having a sub-optimal shape [07:33.1] under your chest and under your feet [07:35.1] when I was around 18 I started buying [07:36.8] these fishier sort of small wave [07:39.4] surfboards because they had instant up [07:41.5] and got instant speed [07:43.6] which can be really helpful in certain [07:44.8] types of conditions but they also have [07:47.6] distinct limitations which I think held [07:50.0] me back over the years essentially those [07:52.3] boards put a ceiling on the type of [07:55.1] waves that I could Surf and the size of [07:56.8] waves that I could Surf and how critical [07:58.7] of a maneuver that I could perform on [08:02.0] those waves far too many people these [08:03.9] days are on Tiny surfboards boards that [08:06.3] are way too small for them and they're [08:08.3] prematurely running out of energy in the [08:10.6] surf they're missing waves and then when [08:12.6] they're on the wave they tend to run out [08:14.8] of speed and I think overall in general [08:17.2] Surfers are chronically under volumeed [08:19.8] with their surfboards this is because in [08:22.4] the past we've equated more volume with [08:24.8] less responsiveness and I think nowadays [08:28.6] that's not always a neat sort of [08:31.4] relationship I'm actually working on [08:33.4] something here a signature shape a [08:36.1] solution to the problem that I see at [08:37.7] least 75 of surfers everywhere in the [08:40.5] world dealing with it's not quite ready [08:43.3] yet but when it is I'm gonna obviously [08:45.2] share it with you here in the meantime [08:46.7] though try experimenting with a bigger [08:49.4] surfboard perhaps a performance mid [08:51.9] length or something in that category see [08:54.4] how it improves your paddling your wave [08:56.3] catching abilities and [08:58.4] the big critical question is does it [09:01.0] actually hold you back at all whilst [09:03.2] you're on the way of Surfing and most of [09:05.2] the time I would say no so give it a [09:07.7] crack and let me know what you think and [09:09.4] finally I wish I knew that almost [09:11.6] everything that I wanted to achieve in [09:13.1] my surfing from getting Barrel to doing [09:16.5] big as and doing critical Maneuvers [09:18.7] could be distilled down to the [09:20.1] development of two fundamental skills [09:22.3] the bottom turn and the top turn both on [09:25.1] the forehand and the back end these [09:27.1] fundamental skills provide a framework [09:30.2] for most of surfing's expression and [09:33.2] that's why they are really the the main [09:36.1] focus points the basis of the [09:37.9] curriculums that we've built in the [09:39.2] surface roadmap these movements when [09:41.3] executed properly and optimally are the [09:44.9] perfect combination of compression and [09:47.6] extension and rotation which is [09:50.3] essentially what surfing is and they can [09:53.1] foster that kinesthetic understanding of [09:56.6] almost every other maneuver in surfing [09:59.2] let's work on those things now together [10:00.8] on the smooth star [10:02.5] we're going to set up two sections on [10:04.9] this concrete Wave here [10:07.0] the first section is a top turn section [10:09.7] marked with the three cones [10:13.2] our second section immediately after is [10:16.7] a re-entry section marked here by the [10:19.1] two cones initially approach this as a [10:21.5] forehand wave and really focus on the [10:23.8] timing of the ease into compression [10:26.2] which starts here at the first cone [10:29.9] and then the more explosive extension [10:33.1] which happens as you pass the second [10:35.6] cone [10:38.1] form the top turn with good technique [10:39.9] and really focus on extending the back [10:42.4] leg and transitioning straight into your [10:44.8] next bottom turn and re-entry maneuver [10:47.5] practicing this exercise filming [10:49.7] yourself and then comparing it to good [10:51.2] Surfers is a fantastic way to achieve [10:53.7] repetition and to more fully understand [10:55.8] the subtle dynamics of power expression [10:58.6] in surfing foreign [11:04.7] so

    "text": "[00:00.1] [Applause] [00:00.3] I'm trying to look and see if I can see [00:01.6] that finger but whatever happens to Y [00:03.6] and whatever has happened we know she [00:05.6] ain't going to give up out there she's [00:07.2] going to give it everything yeah a look [00:08.7] of concern on the coach's face you have [00:10.6] to say and we don't know what happened [00:12.6] we expect y picked up some sort of [00:14.9] finger injury just to explain in case [00:16.6] you didn't catch that boulder around [00:18.0] there a bit of a Grimace after Boulder [00:19.5] too and we don't know at what point we [00:21.1] don't have any more information from you [00:23.5] uh for you but what y needs to do if she [00:26.0] wants to take the top spot is hold 72 [00:29.4] points and you can see that there you [00:30.6] can see just how high she's got these [00:32.7] women have given her a run for her money [00:36.0] because they've not handed it to her by [00:37.6] any means she's going to have to fight [00:39.0] if she wants a second Olympic medal and [00:41.2] she wants gold she's going to have to [00:42.5] have the climb of her life that was such [00:44.2] a great performance from Jesse but now [00:46.5] all eyes on y yeah so she's underway [00:50.1] now finger she won't show any pain if [00:53.7] she's feeling it she's a competitor she [00:56.5] understands you need to keep these [00:57.6] things in Fight Hard Out On The Wall out [01:00.0] with the right hand she's climbing [01:01.2] quickly at the [01:02.6] moment coming into this you know she's [01:05.4] she is the greatest athlete of all time [01:07.4] and in our Sport and arguably across [01:10.0] sport if you look at certain statistics [01:12.1] and she said on social that she is [01:13.7] another step closer and she just left it [01:16.2] there she didn't see anything else [01:18.2] recently there's been some interviews [01:19.8] with her that have come out unfiltered [01:21.6] interviews and it's great to get a bit [01:24.2] more insight into someone who doesn't [01:25.7] tend to be that open she doesn't do that [01:28.1] that much media and you know she done so [01:30.4] much for our sport she's really [01:31.8] passionate she really cares about the [01:33.2] progress of it too and to be as good as [01:35.3] she is and to do as much as she does for [01:37.2] the positive progression of the sport [01:39.2] it's just a testament to who she is as a [01:41.0] human being not just an athlete so she's [01:43.9] into this ShakeOut position no sign of [01:46.4] this finger injury [01:48.4] yet Brooke talking there to Jesse about [01:51.7] the route itself remember Brook [01:53.6] guaranteed a silver medal at least here [01:56.7] again you're looking down at that skin [01:58.7] he's chalking up the skin her fingers [02:00.4] since she looks right towards the [02:01.9] Traverse she goes all the way from the [02:03.4] left hand side of the wall all the way [02:04.8] to the right with that 30 point score [02:07.2] beckons yeah taking a longer pause there [02:11.2] than we're used to seeing y take but [02:13.7] that doesn't suggest very much you know [02:15.6] the enormity of this pressure and this [02:18.6] moment for her is impossible to describe [02:22.0] and she's going to be using everything [02:24.0] that she can pulling on the breadth of [02:26.2] experience you know all of those medals [02:28.0] she's got to her name to compose herself [02:30.2] and focus as she moves through this [02:32.6] climb yeah she's not 100% Yan yet from [02:36.6] what I can [02:37.7] see she's maybe just having to work a [02:40.3] little harder yeah but you can't see [02:43.9] much in the way of her having to [02:45.2] struggle yet that's for sure you know [02:46.7] her arms are straight her body movements [02:48.7] are smooth she's looking relaxed her [02:51.0] head's not looking around her shoulders [02:52.6] are nice and low she does look pretty [02:54.8] calm and collected to me all right well [02:56.8] she's into the next scoring place now [02:58.9] three points per hole and this has moved [03:01.2] straight up into fifth place creeping [03:03.8] towards the [03:05.2] medals up with the right hand little bit [03:08.1] of an adjustment and then bumps into [03:10.1] this left side [03:11.4] po high heel and another chance to chalk [03:14.4] up have a shake we talk about the [03:16.4] pressure piled on y more pressure comes [03:19.1] from herself than she feels from anyone [03:21.0] else and she has been at the top of the [03:23.4] sport for what feels like forever and [03:24.8] she's only 25 years old and I think it's [03:29.4] really impressive for someone to [03:31.1] dominate for so long and she said that's [03:32.9] what inspires her seeing athletes stay [03:34.8] at the top of their game for so long [03:36.4] coach looking a lot more convinced and a [03:39.2] lot happier and I think he'll have been [03:40.8] nervous about seeing what state she was [03:42.6] in how she was climbing where her flow [03:44.8] was but she's looking flowy to me yeah [03:47.6] she is she's guaranteed a medal now so [03:49.4] that's bronze for yya she won't be [03:51.8] satisfied with that though she also [03:53.6] doesn't know dropping down as well to [03:55.4] rest you say she won't be satisfied [03:57.0] she's got no idea that she's got a medal [03:59.0] right now and you know she's not here [04:00.2] for a bronze medal she's not here for a [04:01.6] silver medal she said herself she's here [04:03.8] for a gold medal she wants a second one [04:06.4] and yes she's dropping down not [04:08.0] something we see y do but she is looking [04:10.3] move as she moves through the Section [04:11.7] and I think we could see a great display [04:13.8] from y on this route and she didn't get [04:15.6] to show her best self in Boulder but she [04:19.0] looked like she was struggling with that [04:21.0] clip there didn't she yeah she did well [04:22.8] that's silver so she's guaranteed silver [04:25.1] now just bronze gold to come there is [04:27.8] that first place move she gets that hand [04:30.2] she does it oh it's not it it's not she [04:32.8] didn't secure it she reaches for the [04:34.4] clip and now she gets it she shifts her [04:36.6] away brings her foot up the crowd are [04:38.0] going wild I don't think she'll quite [04:39.8] know she'll want to finish this round on [04:41.5] the top Brook rabitu cheering and [04:43.1] screaming she knows now she's got a [04:44.8] silver medal can Yan make the dream [04:47.7] happen and finish this round with a top [04:50.6] I don't think anyone really cares [04:52.0] because she is the gold medalist she's [04:53.5] done it again despite everything she's [04:55.2] faced Yan gambra is your gold medalist [04:58.7] yeah Yan will take Victory here Brooks [05:00.8] celebrating with her is guaranteed that [05:02.6] silver medal now we know our finals and [05:05.0] Y look at that emotion as she comes down [05:08.0] she had to dig so so deep I think deeper [05:10.6] than we know out there on the wall and [05:13.7] another goal that's the second time she [05:15.8] is a two-time Olympic [05:18.9] champion she isn't the best because it's [05:22.4] given to her she works so hard she [05:25.1] fights so hard she had to push to come [05:27.8] back after Tokyo you know that dip that [05:30.4] she felt she didn't know she'd everever [05:31.8] want to climb again she didn't know she [05:33.1] ever could because it's the enormity of [05:35.3] winning the Tokyo games but she is now a [05:37.8] two-time Olympic gold medalist no one [05:40.8] else in our sport can say that Yan G BR [05:43.3] soak it in hi I'm Ellie Simmons [05:46.3] subscribe
