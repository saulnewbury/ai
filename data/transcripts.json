    "text": "[00:00.1] I've been surfing for over 20 years now [00:12.4] that surfing is my job I've taken a [00:15.8] particular interest in the science of [00:18.6] learning it and I'm as obsessed with it [00:22.0] as ever [00:23.8] as far as Sports go it's a really tricky [00:26.4] one to progress because the changing [00:29.3] nature of the ocean and waves makes [00:31.6] repetition a little hard to come by but [00:35.2] there are some Surefire ways to [00:37.4] guarantee and fast track your surfing [00:40.0] progress and today I'm going to share [00:42.2] five of them with you because [00:44.1] man I wish I knew about them when I [00:46.6] started [00:48.8] and make sure you stick around to the [00:50.8] end of the video because I'm going to [00:52.3] teach you guys a really helpful training [00:53.9] routine that's going to totally [00:55.1] transform your surfing [01:07.0] this video is brought to you by my [01:08.5] online surfing University the Surfers [01:10.7] roadmap whether it's a structured [01:12.5] surfscape program choosing the right [01:14.5] SURFboard or progressing from beginner [01:16.7] to intermediate we've got you covered [01:18.5] with top quality online courses check it [01:21.5] out via the link in the description [01:22.9] below [01:28.4] number one the fact that you can [01:30.8] progress at any age I think there's a [01:33.4] general conception that as you get older [01:36.1] attaining skills is harder but in [01:39.7] surfing I found that this is not quite [01:42.4] the case you can progress just as fast [01:44.5] in your mid-20s mid 30s mid 40s with the [01:47.6] right approach and that is probably key [01:50.5] the right approach there are three main [01:52.3] factors to get this right and number one [01:53.9] is mindset science shows pretty clearly [01:56.6] that if you have the belief that you can [01:59.3] learn something then it's going to have [02:00.8] a major impact on whether you actually [02:03.1] do obviously if you have the confidence [02:04.9] and the belief that you can actually [02:06.9] attain a certain level of Surfing this [02:10.2] means that it becomes more possible for [02:12.9] you to do so and number two frequency of [02:15.8] practice I'm sorry but you probably need [02:18.7] to start surfing more than once a week [02:21.2] if you want to progress [02:22.7] with any sort of uh Pace three is [02:26.3] obviously quality of guidance and input [02:29.2] into your surfing which is literally the [02:32.3] main reason I created the surface [02:34.3] roadmap surface have suffered from a [02:36.8] lack of clarity when it comes to a [02:39.1] step-by-step approach to improving their [02:40.7] surfing so if you believe you can [02:42.7] improve if you commit to serving a lot [02:45.7] or at least as much as you can more than [02:48.5] you probably think you need to and you [02:50.8] actually gain a clear picture of what it [02:53.2] is exactly you're trying to achieve with [02:55.1] your surfing that is you get good [02:56.7] guidance and steps on how to actually [02:59.5] achieve those tangible things then [03:02.6] progression will come at any age number [03:05.3] two that overcoming a fear of ways [03:08.2] actually requires a step-by-step [03:10.5] approach many Surfers when they start to [03:13.1] have a fear of a certain size of wave [03:16.1] now I'm here to tell you that every [03:18.5] Surfer has a fear of a certain size of [03:21.8] wave it's just all relative to their [03:23.9] experience the big mistake here is [03:26.1] presuming that there's something wrong [03:27.5] with you for fearing that wave and maybe [03:30.2] assuming that every other Surfer the [03:32.8] surface that you aspire to be like don't [03:34.9] have a fear of waves and that's simply [03:36.2] not true everybody no matter who you're [03:38.2] looking at has a fear of a certain type [03:40.2] of wave and the main factor here is [03:42.5] their experience their exposure I found [03:44.9] that by gradually exposing yourself to [03:47.6] waves slightly out of your comfort zone [03:49.9] is the best way to deaden and [03:53.2] desensitize yourself to those types of [03:56.1] waves and before you know it actually [03:58.0] happens without you really noticing the [04:00.7] ways that you used to be scared of all [04:02.4] of a sudden and no longer scary to you I [04:05.2] grew up in Adelaide which literally has [04:07.5] no surf it took me almost into my 20s [04:11.1] before I could even fathom surfing away [04:13.4] of over four foot and yet now it's [04:17.4] become a lot more possible and I [04:19.0] actually start to chase those waves and [04:21.5] really enjoy it and the next level up [04:23.8] that scares me is obviously a lot bigger [04:25.9] the way I was able to do that was [04:27.6] through gradual exposure over a number [04:29.8] of years two waves slightly outside my [04:32.9] comfort zone now obviously we don't want [04:34.9] to push you too much because that's [04:36.1] going to cause anxiety if we look at the [04:37.7] science of Flow State we want to [04:40.0] slightly challenge you and then that's [04:42.6] going to eventually bring up your skill [04:44.5] level to be able to match that of the [04:46.8] more intense ways the fear itself never [04:49.4] actually goes away it just takes a [04:51.4] bigger wave to instill it in you now [04:53.7] essentially our yardstick our measuring [04:55.7] device has changed quick tip if being [04:58.9] out in challenging surf with a surfboard [05:01.5] tied to you via a leg rope is a [05:05.0] challenging and scary idea for you which [05:06.8] it is for a lot of people and I [05:08.3] recommend going out and actually [05:09.9] swimming amongst the lineup to start to [05:13.1] develop that confidence and to settle [05:15.8] you in take you out of your head a [05:17.8] little bit obviously you need to be a [05:19.2] good swimmer though number three is that [05:21.9] surfscape training can pretty much [05:25.3] perfect your on-wave Technique [05:28.0] especially if you're an intermediate [05:30.3] server as I mentioned at the start of [05:32.1] this video and surfing repetition is [05:34.1] hard to come by and that's why I've used [05:36.8] surf skates consistently for myself and [05:39.1] my clients to great success over the [05:42.1] years because you can get that [05:44.3] repetition on land in a safe controlled [05:47.6] environment I wish that I knew this when [05:50.1] I was younger because I could have upped [05:51.7] my my game so much quicker but instead [05:55.1] it just took me a really long time the [05:56.6] reason I say this works especially well [05:58.0] for intermediates is because a certain [06:00.7] level of kind aesthetic awareness of [06:02.9] what a wave feels like is a really good [06:05.9] way to inform your online surfscape [06:09.1] training and help you visualize how the [06:13.4] on land techniques correspond to the [06:16.4] on-wave techniques the curriculum that I [06:18.8] developed for the ultimate surfscape [06:20.9] program is built around those [06:22.7] fundamental movements of Surfing so even [06:25.7] if you are a beginner you can use that [06:28.6] to begin to generate that kinesthetic [06:31.9] awareness it's not going to be exactly [06:34.2] the same because obviously waves move [06:35.8] but you can start to inform your on-wave [06:38.6] surfing with the training that you do on [06:42.1] land on the surf skates as well at that [06:44.3] point we have this bi-directional [06:45.9] relationship between what you're doing [06:47.3] out in the water on a wave and what [06:49.0] you're doing on land and we see this [06:50.4] crossover this integration of skills and [06:54.1] skill development that can really fast [06:56.3] track your surfing progress really [06:58.0] important tip when you are implementing [06:59.9] surfscape training make sure you are [07:01.7] visualizing actively a wave when you are [07:05.2] doing it now I'm going to give you a [07:06.3] really helpful exercise at the end of [07:07.7] this video as well number four the right [07:09.9] surfboard now if you're a grommet and [07:12.0] you weigh 30 kilos whatever you can [07:14.5] pretty much get away with you know the [07:16.1] wrong surfboard for for years but if [07:18.1] you're late teens early 20s and beyond [07:20.2] all the way through 50s 60s 70s ladies [07:23.3] then getting the right surfboard is [07:25.7] going to take the pressure off it's [07:27.6] going to remove the bottleneck that can [07:29.8] exist through having a sub-optimal shape [07:33.1] under your chest and under your feet [07:35.1] when I was around 18 I started buying [07:36.8] these fishier sort of small wave [07:39.4] surfboards because they had instant up [07:41.5] and got instant speed [07:43.6] which can be really helpful in certain [07:44.8] types of conditions but they also have [07:47.6] distinct limitations which I think held [07:50.0] me back over the years essentially those [07:52.3] boards put a ceiling on the type of [07:55.1] waves that I could Surf and the size of [07:56.8] waves that I could Surf and how critical [07:58.7] of a maneuver that I could perform on [08:02.0] those waves far too many people these [08:03.9] days are on Tiny surfboards boards that [08:06.3] are way too small for them and they're [08:08.3] prematurely running out of energy in the [08:10.6] surf they're missing waves and then when [08:12.6] they're on the wave they tend to run out [08:14.8] of speed and I think overall in general [08:17.2] Surfers are chronically under volumeed [08:19.8] with their surfboards this is because in [08:22.4] the past we've equated more volume with [08:24.8] less responsiveness and I think nowadays [08:28.6] that's not always a neat sort of [08:31.4] relationship I'm actually working on [08:33.4] something here a signature shape a [08:36.1] solution to the problem that I see at [08:37.7] least 75 of surfers everywhere in the [08:40.5] world dealing with it's not quite ready [08:43.3] yet but when it is I'm gonna obviously [08:45.2] share it with you here in the meantime [08:46.7] though try experimenting with a bigger [08:49.4] surfboard perhaps a performance mid [08:51.9] length or something in that category see [08:54.4] how it improves your paddling your wave [08:56.3] catching abilities and [08:58.4] the big critical question is does it [09:01.0] actually hold you back at all whilst [09:03.2] you're on the way of Surfing and most of [09:05.2] the time I would say no so give it a [09:07.7] crack and let me know what you think and [09:09.4] finally I wish I knew that almost [09:11.6] everything that I wanted to achieve in [09:13.1] my surfing from getting Barrel to doing [09:16.5] big as and doing critical Maneuvers [09:18.7] could be distilled down to the [09:20.1] development of two fundamental skills [09:22.3] the bottom turn and the top turn both on [09:25.1] the forehand and the back end these [09:27.1] fundamental skills provide a framework [09:30.2] for most of surfing's expression and [09:33.2] that's why they are really the the main [09:36.1] focus points the basis of the [09:37.9] curriculums that we've built in the [09:39.2] surface roadmap these movements when [09:41.3] executed properly and optimally are the [09:44.9] perfect combination of compression and [09:47.6] extension and rotation which is [09:50.3] essentially what surfing is and they can [09:53.1] foster that kinesthetic understanding of [09:56.6] almost every other maneuver in surfing [09:59.2] let's work on those things now together [10:00.8] on the smooth star [10:02.5] we're going to set up two sections on [10:04.9] this concrete Wave here [10:07.0] the first section is a top turn section [10:09.7] marked with the three cones [10:13.2] our second section immediately after is [10:16.7] a re-entry section marked here by the [10:19.1] two cones initially approach this as a [10:21.5] forehand wave and really focus on the [10:23.8] timing of the ease into compression [10:26.2] which starts here at the first cone [10:29.9] and then the more explosive extension [10:33.1] which happens as you pass the second [10:35.6] cone [10:38.1] form the top turn with good technique [10:39.9] and really focus on extending the back [10:42.4] leg and transitioning straight into your [10:44.8] next bottom turn and re-entry maneuver [10:47.5] practicing this exercise filming [10:49.7] yourself and then comparing it to good [10:51.2] Surfers is a fantastic way to achieve [10:53.7] repetition and to more fully understand [10:55.8] the subtle dynamics of power expression [10:58.6] in surfing foreign [11:04.7] so there you have it those are the five [11:06.7] things that I wish that I had in my [11:09.1] arsenal when I was growing up trying to [11:11.2] be [11:12.1] professional Surfer guys if you're new [11:14.9] here make sure you subscribe to the [11:16.4] channel hit the like button uh let me [11:18.5] know in the comments which point which [11:20.8] uh tip stood out most to you and [11:23.2] resonated most with you remember that [11:25.6] I've helped thousands almost tens of [11:28.2] thousands of students now reach their [11:30.9] serving goals via the surfersroadmap.com [11:33.5] and our retreats in person so make sure [11:35.5] you check that out by the link in the [11:36.8] description below you can also join me [11:39.1] and the Surfers roadmap on Instagram at [11:42.1] kales broccoli at the surface roadmap [11:45.0] I'll see you guys next time thanks so [11:47.2] much for tuning in",

    "text": "[00:00.1] [Applause] [00:00.3] I'm trying to look and see if I can see [00:01.6] that finger but whatever happens to Y [00:03.6] and whatever has happened we know she [00:05.6] ain't going to give up out there she's [00:07.2] going to give it everything yeah a look [00:08.7] of concern on the coach's face you have [00:10.6] to say and we don't know what happened [00:12.6] we expect y picked up some sort of [00:14.9] finger injury just to explain in case [00:16.6] you didn't catch that boulder around [00:18.0] there a bit of a Grimace after Boulder [00:19.5] too and we don't know at what point we [00:21.1] don't have any more information from you [00:23.5] uh for you but what y needs to do if she [00:26.0] wants to take the top spot is hold 72 [00:29.4] points and you can see that there you [00:30.6] can see just how high she's got these [00:32.7] women have given her a run for her money [00:36.0] because they've not handed it to her by [00:37.6] any means she's going to have to fight [00:39.0] if she wants a second Olympic medal and [00:41.2] she wants gold she's going to have to [00:42.5] have the climb of her life that was such [00:44.2] a great performance from Jesse but now [00:46.5] all eyes on y yeah so she's underway [00:50.1] now finger she won't show any pain if [00:53.7] she's feeling it she's a competitor she [00:56.5] understands you need to keep these [00:57.6] things in Fight Hard Out On The Wall out [01:00.0] with the right hand she's climbing [01:01.2] quickly at the [01:02.6] moment coming into this you know she's [01:05.4] she is the greatest athlete of all time [01:07.4] and in our Sport and arguably across [01:10.0] sport if you look at certain statistics [01:12.1] and she said on social that she is [01:13.7] another step closer and she just left it [01:16.2] there she didn't see anything else [01:18.2] recently there's been some interviews [01:19.8] with her that have come out unfiltered [01:21.6] interviews and it's great to get a bit [01:24.2] more insight into someone who doesn't [01:25.7] tend to be that open she doesn't do that [01:28.1] that much media and you know she done so [01:30.4] much for our sport she's really [01:31.8] passionate she really cares about the [01:33.2] progress of it too and to be as good as [01:35.3] she is and to do as much as she does for [01:37.2] the positive progression of the sport [01:39.2] it's just a testament to who she is as a [01:41.0] human being not just an athlete so she's [01:43.9] into this ShakeOut position no sign of [01:46.4] this finger injury [01:48.4] yet Brooke talking there to Jesse about [01:51.7] the route itself remember Brook [01:53.6] guaranteed a silver medal at least here [01:56.7] again you're looking down at that skin [01:58.7] he's chalking up the skin her fingers [02:00.4] since she looks right towards the [02:01.9] Traverse she goes all the way from the [02:03.4] left hand side of the wall all the way [02:04.8] to the right with that 30 point score [02:07.2] beckons yeah taking a longer pause there [02:11.2] than we're used to seeing y take but [02:13.7] that doesn't suggest very much you know [02:15.6] the enormity of this pressure and this [02:18.6] moment for her is impossible to describe [02:22.0] and she's going to be using everything [02:24.0] that she can pulling on the breadth of [02:26.2] experience you know all of those medals [02:28.0] she's got to her name to compose herself [02:30.2] and focus as she moves through this [02:32.6] climb yeah she's not 100% Yan yet from [02:36.6] what I can [02:37.7] see she's maybe just having to work a [02:40.3] little harder yeah but you can't see [02:43.9] much in the way of her having to [02:45.2] struggle yet that's for sure you know [02:46.7] her arms are straight her body movements [02:48.7] are smooth she's looking relaxed her [02:51.0] head's not looking around her shoulders [02:52.6] are nice and low she does look pretty [02:54.8] calm and collected to me all right well [02:56.8] she's into the next scoring place now [02:58.9] three points per hole and this has moved [03:01.2] straight up into fifth place creeping [03:03.8] towards the [03:05.2] medals up with the right hand little bit [03:08.1] of an adjustment and then bumps into [03:10.1] this left side [03:11.4] po high heel and another chance to chalk [03:14.4] up have a shake we talk about the [03:16.4] pressure piled on y more pressure comes [03:19.1] from herself than she feels from anyone [03:21.0] else and she has been at the top of the [03:23.4] sport for what feels like forever and [03:24.8] she's only 25 years old and I think it's [03:29.4] really impressive for someone to [03:31.1] dominate for so long and she said that's [03:32.9] what inspires her seeing athletes stay [03:34.8] at the top of their game for so long [03:36.4] coach looking a lot more convinced and a [03:39.2] lot happier and I think he'll have been [03:40.8] nervous about seeing what state she was [03:42.6] in how she was climbing where her flow [03:44.8] was but she's looking flowy to me yeah [03:47.6] she is she's guaranteed a medal now so [03:49.4] that's bronze for yya she won't be [03:51.8] satisfied with that though she also [03:53.6] doesn't know dropping down as well to [03:55.4] rest you say she won't be satisfied [03:57.0] she's got no idea that she's got a medal [03:59.0] right now and you know she's not here [04:00.2] for a bronze medal she's not here for a [04:01.6] silver medal she said herself she's here [04:03.8] for a gold medal she wants a second one [04:06.4] and yes she's dropping down not [04:08.0] something we see y do but she is looking [04:10.3] move as she moves through the Section [04:11.7] and I think we could see a great display [04:13.8] from y on this route and she didn't get [04:15.6] to show her best self in Boulder but she [04:19.0] looked like she was struggling with that [04:21.0] clip there didn't she yeah she did well [04:22.8] that's silver so she's guaranteed silver [04:25.1] now just bronze gold to come there is [04:27.8] that first place move she gets that hand [04:30.2] she does it oh it's not it it's not she [04:32.8] didn't secure it she reaches for the [04:34.4] clip and now she gets it she shifts her [04:36.6] away brings her foot up the crowd are [04:38.0] going wild I don't think she'll quite [04:39.8] know she'll want to finish this round on [04:41.5] the top Brook rabitu cheering and [04:43.1] screaming she knows now she's got a [04:44.8] silver medal can Yan make the dream [04:47.7] happen and finish this round with a top [04:50.6] I don't think anyone really cares [04:52.0] because she is the gold medalist she's [04:53.5] done it again despite everything she's [04:55.2] faced Yan gambra is your gold medalist [04:58.7] yeah Yan will take Victory here Brooks [05:00.8] celebrating with her is guaranteed that [05:02.6] silver medal now we know our finals and [05:05.0] Y look at that emotion as she comes down [05:08.0] she had to dig so so deep I think deeper [05:10.6] than we know out there on the wall and [05:13.7] another goal that's the second time she [05:15.8] is a two-time Olympic [05:18.9] champion she isn't the best because it's [05:22.4] given to her she works so hard she [05:25.1] fights so hard she had to push to come [05:27.8] back after Tokyo you know that dip that [05:30.4] she felt she didn't know she'd everever [05:31.8] want to climb again she didn't know she [05:33.1] ever could because it's the enormity of [05:35.3] winning the Tokyo games but she is now a [05:37.8] two-time Olympic gold medalist no one [05:40.8] else in our sport can say that Yan G BR [05:43.3] soak it in hi I'm Ellie Simmons [05:46.3] subscribe
