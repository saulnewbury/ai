    "text": "Good morning, Everybody. United Kingdom, September 13th. Have you heard about that? If you want on these, you get them@nationware.co.uk I've got my baseball cap, UTK, everything's ready. So I want to say thank you. I want to say thank you to every single person who blindly defended me. Everyone who I watched, commentator after commentator. I was told by my solicitors, don't open your mouth. In the minute after this incident happened, I'm going to be honest, possibly one of the worst weeks of my life. I was worried, very worried. I thought I was being stitched up. I didn't think that they'd have the CCTV. I was detained yesterday on GBH618 and I was interviewed. And what my request would be right now is release the footage for the public to see, okay? That's what everyone needs to see the footage. Not that little clip. You need to see the footage. Don't listen to the accounts given in newspapers. You need to see the footage. Okay? What the footage will show you is I was walking home, another gentleman who wasn't, who come off the train, so. And he, he should be leaving St Pancras, saw me, followed me, confronted me, got here in my face for minutes. Yeah. I tried to get away from him. I tried everything. I tried telling him to leave me alone. I warned him so many times, please get away. Stop accosting me. Right? Leave me alone. He threatened me. He continually chased me, basically. Yeah. Until the point when we get to the top of the stairs, which is where some. There are some accounts of what happened, but no one's seen what happened previously. Thank God it's on cctv. You can see him harassing me in my face so much. Yeah. And you can see me trying to get away. So much. So at which point, the only time when I. And I, I didn't defend myself, even though I probably should have. When you watch the footage, I should have done it a minute before. I didn't defend myself until it become to a physical confrontation. Until he came at me. And as he comes at me, I defended myself. That's it. And that's what's on camera. He charges at me. Doesn't just come at me, he charges at me. Yeah. With his hands up. So listen, I wish him well. I do not blame that gentleman because he's been lied to by a fake news media. He's been told I'm Satan, he's been told I'm someone I'm not. So I don't blame him. Yeah. At the same time, I'M not a human punchback. I have to be able to walk streets. I think. Unfortunately I've come to the realization now I can't walk the streets because the worry and fear I've had for the last seven days. Let me get some other points clear. Yeah. I contacted the police, me straight away, okay. I told them exactly what I saw on the CCV yesterday, exactly what I told him. I was trying to get home, I was accosted, I was followed, I was threatened, I was harassed and then in the end I had to defend myself. That's exactly what the footage shows. Okay? Now I don't believe there's even a complainant in this case. So I've been arrested. I don't believe there's a complaint. I believe when the complainant sees the footage, he was drunk, he's gonna have woke up with a sore red. Right. But he was drunk as well. But I think when he sees the footage. I don't believe there's complaining in this case, but I'm not. I can't go into other details due to my bail conditions, but I've been released on bail till 2nd September, as I said. Thank you. Because all the people who blindly defended me, you know who I am, you know, I just don't go around punching people. Come on, man. In fact, I take a lot of criticism, I take a lot of abuse. I don't react with them and react with them when it's last resort and I need to defend myself because I'm not going to be the man laying on the floor. That's not going to be me. And unfortunately some people would only be happy if it's me with a forensic tent. Yeah. And it wasn't okay. And just to clear something up for the media, the media said I went on the run. So I produced to the police, which let me get sound clear. I rang the police straight away. I contacted the police straight away. Yeah, my solicitors contacted them at six o' clock the next morning. We made them aware of where I was, made them aware of the date I was coming home already. Now, just so you know, I've showed evidence to the police that my accommodation, everything was booked before this incident. So before this incident happened, I had a trip planned. Fact. If I had tried to escape the country like the media have told you, if I went on the run like the media told you, I wouldn't now have my passport, would I? That's not. I don't have a bail condition to stay in the country. I don't have any of those bail conditions. So also the police. What's very strange for me is when I landed at Lulu, you may have seen the scenes of all the police cars, of all the police. It's me that told them I arranged to come back. I was flying into Manchester. I changed my flight for them, so I don't know why they made that big scene. And you get the video of all those police wagons arresting me when I was coming back for an interview that I planned from the minute it happened. I'd been in cooperation with the police. There was no running away. There never has been. Yeah, I willingly come back, but I was coming back when I was coming back anyway. So anyway, this is a thank you from me. September 13th is going full ahead. Full scene ahead. It's gonna be bigger than ever. Self defense is the defense. Yeah. It's not crime. If someone comes up and wants to accost me, confront me and attempt to attack me, I'm within my rights to defend myself. I wish I didn't have to. I really wish I didn't have to. I really wish that man well. And I hope he gets better and I hope he makes a full recovery. And I didn't want what happened that day to happen. I just wanted to go home. And I've had the worst week, as I'm sure his family have. Yeah, maybe it's been a lesson for him. It's been a lesson for me. I can't walk the streets of this country on my own. And unfortunately, that's what I walk everywhere I'm in London, Luton, everywhere I go. I just go on my own, I think. So what? Oh, I'll deal with it. But I shouldn't have to deal with it. And unfortunately now realize that there's too much of a risk there. It's too much of a risk for me. I can do nothing wrong but still be seen to do something wrong. Look at the media this week, man. Look at what they've portrayed and how it's been portrayed in forensic. Forensic tents. Blood transfusion. There was no blood transfusion. All the newspaper sound as a blood transfusion. It's all. He weren't 64. It's a lie. They lied about his age. Everything a lie. But thank you, everyone. Okay. After seeing the cctv, I know there's not a jury in the world would convict me of that. So my request to the Metro One police force is release the footage, Let the public see. Okay? Too much bullshit's been happening this week for the last seven days. I've had to watch listen to it and read it, okay? I know what happened that day. And I know the man I am. And every one of you know the man I am. I'm not coward, okay? I'm not a coward. I don't just provoke reactions. I don't provoke trouble. And I don't just throw punches willy nilly either. That's only at last resort as defense. So thank you, everyone. Yeah. Utk. Come on. September 13th. Nationware.co.uk get yours right, let's go.",

    "text": "The Zionist bruh. You what? The Zionist bruh. Do you even know what a Zionist is? Yes. Tell me. A Jewish person. So you're just saying f Jewish people? Basically every single one of them. Basically. Huh. You're Muslim? You understand Arabic? Yeah. Yeah. How about this? Where are you from? I'm Syrian. Turkish. Syrian. Turkey. That explains the hate. You all got a lot of hate. No, I don't. I don't hate Jews. I'm joking. So this one thing that blows my mind with Syrians. Yeah. Is they obsess over the war between Israel and Gaza. No. No. I couldn't give a Fuck. One year, 130,000 dead in 2014, and the world didn't even notice in Syria. Assad Daesh. They can kill as many as they want and nobody cared. But if Israel sneezes, y' all come out, protest and screaming, death to Yahud. Who? Syrians. Not Syrians, but the Ummah. The Ummah? The Muslims. Yeah. That's because you are trying to destroy the most sacred place. No, second most sacred place. But do you know why Masjid Al Aqsa is holy to you guys? Yeah. Because the Messiah is gonna go there. So where does Quds get its name from? Huh? Al Quds. Where does it get its name from? Oh, Al Q. Yeah. Do you know what the bait Al Maktis was? It was our temple. It's our holiest site. Oh, that's crazy. Anyway. What? You Muslim or Jewish? Yahude, of course. It's all right. You know what I mean? It's not that deep. If we can live in the same world together, then it's no problem, inshallah. You get me? You'll just need to calm down. Let us have our one country. You have your like. No, you don't just need to let Palestine at least be, bro. But what does that mean? Let it be like you are trying to take over a whole country? Well, you say that belongs to you? Yeah. Wait. Allah subhanahu wa ta' ala says it belongs to us. Your God said it belongs to you. Our God? You worship Allah. I worship Allah. The God of Ibrahim Isa. Yeah. Then it's the same God, bro. Okay, but still we don't believe in the same thing, Abhit. Do you believe Musa Rasulallah? I believe in the prophets. Yes, I believe in the prophets. But you're trying to say that. It's like saying, how do I explain this? Like the whole world belongs to us just because our God owns it. It don't make sense. Mecca and Medina belongs to you. No, I mean that is a Muslim area. Yeah, but it used to be Jewish habibi. Yeah, you kicked us all out. You kicked us out and said it's ours now, just like in Israel. No, it's because back then there were no like. Basically, yeah, you know, I mean religions and that. There were no religions back then. No, you don't believe the rock. We believed in rocks. We were worshiping Allah. Subhana wa ta'. Ala. When you're one. Pagans. When they were. No, no, not like that. You lot were basically praying to whoever was the highest on the mountain chain, you get me? And I was saying, fam, you've got it wrong. You've got it badly wrong. Bow down to your king and pray to him. We don't pray to the king. We only pray. There's only one entity we bow down to and that's Allah. Subhanahu wa ta'. Ala. We bow to no man. Type. Type. Come on. I think that's the only thing that we actually singing, you know, I mean, look, you took our profits. Profits. Hold the up. Was that wood? Was it that wood? D? Yeah, it's maybe my pronunciation. That's just yours. That's your prophets. No, he's. He. I mean he was. Yah. He was from Al Yahud. Exactly. But that's not our prophet, is it then? No, no, D is one of your prophet. That's that for Allah. I feel like Ali Dawah here giving you dawah. Instead of calling me Akhiya bro, you can just call me Sheikh. Sheikh Jew. The man knows the Hadith. This man's on his dean. You other boys failed the Islam test. You don't say walaikum salam to you can't wish peace upon a Jew. I stagfu Allah. You don't say it to our Ken. His camera. What is your camera? It's a Sony A6 500. It's to catch all the anti Semites in high definition. Yeah, but I can. I can see every, like, every bit. Yeah, you have to follow the example of Muhammad. So now he gets a point in the Islam test. He's more patient, he's chill, he's slow to anger. Why are we jumping to conflict? Exactly. We need this man in the United Nations Bani Israel and the Ummah can get on once again. We need to give this man a seat at the un. So he gets two points now and the man with his mouth open. You're black. You're black. No point for you, brother. The first person to meet the Azad was a black man in front of a hobbit. Exactly. Give me my points, give me my points. You know, I'll give you an extra point because in that Jewish tradition the, the wife of Musa sallallahu alaihi wasallam was also a black woman. So I don't know if this in the Islamic tradition, but that's in our tradition. Any other prophet, that's not Muhammad, you say, I know, but you guys make mistakes and that's okay because you're on taqeed, you're on La ilaha illa Allah. So we'll forgive you for not giving Musa the appropriate, appropriate respect. So Musa is the only nabi, the only prophet who spoke with Allah Subhanahu wa ta' ala face to face in the Jewish tradition or directly. It wasn't for Jibreel, it wasn't through a messenger, through like an angel. And for us he's clearly the highest prophet, which is why we follow his Sharia and we follow his Sunnah and we give him an appropriate level of respect, the highest honor we can. The Ummah make a mistake and that's fine. They give Muhammad more respect than they give to Musa. But they're still on the deen, they're still on tawhid. So we forgive them. We forgive you guys. You don't get it, all right? But you're close. You're doing better than other religions. But that's according to your religion. That's according to Allah. Subhanahu wa ta'. Ala. What? That Musa should get more respect than Muhammad. Musa is the highest prophet that's ever been, which is why he didn't need an intermediary. But what I would say is you'll need a chill. When you see Jews, you get so excited and so animated. I'm not, I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to like attached to you, you know. Yeah, I just want to speak. Yeah, no, no, respect, respect that the difference between Jews and Zionists, like so. But this is the thing and I'm one of the Zionists. I'm the, I'm the ones you think the bad guys. I don't mind the tubular Zionist. That's different. I'll still like try to be calm about it. But so, so what, what is that? What is a Zionist? A Zionist? It's more. Because when you think of like Judaism you think, you think more of like a nationality, more of like, how do you say? It's a political thing, political stand. But. Well, I'm not going to read the Definition. This is this definition. I'll give you the definition. You don't need to go to chef Google a Zionist? Is anyone that supports the state of the Jews having their own state in the land of Israel political? But all Jews pray for that three times a day. When we eat food, when we go to the synagogue, we're praying to return and rebuild Jerusalem. It's a central tenet of the faith of Judaism. And even the guys you think are anti Zionist like that you see on the protests with the sidekills and the black hats, they're also Zionists. They're just not Zionists yet. They believe it should be in a few years time. You can't separate Zion. The word Zion appears over 100 times in the in the Jewish Bible. And I'll go on further. The word Israel appears 47 times in the Quran. Do you know how many times the word Palestine appears? I don't know. Zero. Muslims get things mixed up. Allah subhanahu wa ta Allah wants Al Yehud in the the land of Barak. The the land of Israel. He wants us there. It was, it says in the Quran he's returned us there as prophesied. He's crushed all of our enemies that have come to take it from us. Even though we were much weaker at the beginning than the Muslim armies that marched on us. It's the will of Allah Subhanahu wa ta' ala that Al Yehuda in Israel today, it's in the Quran, it's in the Torah and it's in the it's in the world now. If Allah didn't want us there, he would kick us out. But Alhamdulillah, I wake up every morning in Al Qut in Yerushalayim and thank Allah that I'm here and that he preserves me and my family in this land. Thousand years ago dude, still with Sheikh Google. I'm on LinkedIn actually Israel was promised thousand years ago, had the most amount of prophets sent to them. Still never embraced Islam. I just want to know why. So I be I don't want to take Muslims out of Islam because I think the central message there's things in Islam I disagree with otherwise I'd be Muslim. But I think the message, central message of La Ilaha Il Allah is a beautiful message and Muslims have carried that to the four corners of the earth and jazakallahu for that. They deserve respect for doing that. From a personal perspective, why I have embraced Islam, why the Al Yehud haven't is we don't believe Allah Subhanahu wa ta' ala makes mistakes. And we don't believe that he'd allow his book to get corrupted as it says in the Quran, even. And so when he sends the Tawrat to Bani Israel by the Nabi Musa, we don't believe that that eternal message is cancelled. We believe that Bani Israel are bound to this. We don't care about anything else. In terms of the religion, this message was given to Musa and we followed it since the time of Musa. We followed the Sharia and the Sunnah of Musa from that time. And there are things in the Quran that would take Al Yahud away from that Sharia. There are contradictions between the two faiths. So while I don't want to take you out of your religion, I don't want to affect your iman from a Jewish perspective. We cannot follow the Quran because of those contradictions with what we believe we're commanded to follow. I'll give you a lot of. It can just be very minute technical laws, but they're very real. So we care about the food we eat. We have to. It's not called halal, obviously, it's called kosher, but it's much, much stricter than, than halal. And one of the laws is when we eat food from the sea, the Torah is explicit. It must have fins and scales. So we can't eat crabs and shellfish and octopus. And the Hanafi, they hold like us, they follow what Al Yahud follow, they also don't. But the actual Quran itself says everything in the sea is lawful. Exactly. And so that would be a contradiction if the Quran's telling me that I can eat an octopus and the Torah saying it's Jahannam if I do as Bani Israel, I have to choose a text. And so that's why Muslims don't follow the Torah. They follow the Quran because the Quran is obviously the last book that the seal of. Like, I don't know how to explain it. I don't know. So I understand that. I'm very familiar with most of the arguments for why you should be Muslim. And I'm happy with you being Muslim, just not me being Muslim. I wake up every morning and say I'm following the Sharia of Musa. But hey, bro, nice meeting you, man. Yeah, likewise, guys. May Allah Subhanahu wa ta' ala guide us all to this right path.",
