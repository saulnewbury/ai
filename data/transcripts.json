    "text": "Like if Jesus came down right now, would you be his son or would you be somebody who's studying Jesus? Like where where does your heart lie right now? Who is your God? Jordan Peterson just went on the George Jenko podcast and things got very real to say the least. Check this out. Why is it that when people ask you if you're a Christian, you don't really answer it like straightforward like, \"Yeah, I follow Jesus Christ. I'm a Christian.\" Because the the question is almost always manipulative that it's not really a question. It's a demand. It's a veiled demand that I declare my allegiance in the manner they see fit at that moment. It's like no thank you. First of all, that's a relatively private manner. And second, just exactly what the hell are you up to? So that's the general, you know, and I'm not I'm not interested in trumpeting it, you know, I'm still figuring things out and I'm trying to explain what I'm learning as I go. And I don't want to parade my virtuous faith, you know, as a proclamation. I think that's false. You know, people can decide for themselves, if they're interested, what I'm up to by watching if they're interested what I do. They can derive their own conclusions and judge them by their fruit. That's the theory. Right. Right. Judge them by their fruit. I just And I when people say too that they're a Christian, I actually generally don't really know what they mean. I mean, you guys laid it out and you provided some indication of what you meant. I'm going to play that moment in a second here because this is George Jenko's wife and she actually, I think, gives a kernel of truth to Dr. Peterson, a story, a perspective that in my view is kind of the key link in the chain of his life that actually might be missing and the source of much of this confusion as it relates to Dr. Peterson and Christianity. We're going to get to that in a second, but let this play out cuz this is also wild right here in this decision that you just made. That's actually worth attending to in my estimation more than a casual declaration. And so I'm not that interested in casual declarations. And people declare their Christianity all the time. And part of me thinks not everyone who says Lord, Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven, right? So be careful what you claim. It's a high bar. I agree. And I I can tell this is very like sensitive to you cuz I feel like you're you know what it is. That Jubilee thing isn't your first rodeo. It's not the first time you've been around wolves that are trying to manipulate you. And I understand that is a touchy subject, but you're such a good reflection of Christians and you're such a good outspoken man that's actually doing something not only for our country, but for the country that you came from. And so I just find that weak men or weak women will look at that as a way of you saying, \"No, no, no, I don't want to be a part of that.\" When they're watching you be so wise and you just waving the flag of confidently, even if they're trying to approach you in a negative way, be like, \"No, I am a man of God. Jesus is my God.\" Then does the Bible verse scare you when they say that they'll deny me in public? I'll deny you in front of my father because you're denying them because they're trying to set you in a trap. But would you not have confidence? I'm denying the questioner ownership over my tongue. I don't like having people put words in my mouth. So what what what do you classify yourself as? Like if Jesus came down right now, would you be his son or would you be somebody who's studying Jesus? Like where where does your heart lie right now? who is your God? And and not I'm not trying to trap you or be disrespectful. I just want to know where your heart lies because the wisdom that you're pouring out into people is something that dude we promote it on our show and we learn from it and we grow from it. So I just want to know who cuz I see you as my mentor. What do you think? I see you're watching I see you as my perspective is that you are a God-fearing man. You're learning and you're taking what God gave you and you're teaching others from your fruits. If I tasted them, I said, \"This is a righteous man that's after God's heart like David.\" But then your mouth will say, \"Who says that I'm a Christian?\" So, it does confuse me as somebody who does watch you. Really well said. That's a good answer. I don't know how to add to that to what you already said. I'm trying to find my way and I'm communicating with people about that voyage as clearly as I possibly can. You're just being honest. You're you're back to when you were writing everything and it's just the truth. As of right now, you're you're Jordan Dr. Jordan Peterson is a man after God's heart and you're just you're finding it. Is this the best way that they could describe you? That's that's good. I like that. And also I see that. I think I'd rather let other people decide. Yeah. I' I'd rather that other I'm I'm public painfully public and so painfully public people can draw their own conclusions and if they want a casual conclusion I'm not interested in providing that and so I don't want to tie everything up in a bow and deliver it as if it's something simple it's not simple and so it's not like I'm trying to be opaque you know when you asked me that question. I'm looking for the words. It's so I asked you what you thought. If I could find the words that would be so sufficiently solid, then I would use them. Have you ever asked God to help you with that? Yes, I would say. I've asked that all the time. All the time. You know, part of seeking for the right words is that's that's an attitude of continual prayer. Is this the right word? You got to feel that out. You're pretty good at that, by the way. You're pretty careful in your choice of words. Thank you. Appreciate that. Mhm. Okay. So, I'm going to now go to her choice of words that he's referring to there. The idea that you have to sacrifice your intellect to be a Christian is absurd. It's absurd. So, and there are ways of understanding Christianity. We've talked about some of them today that are they're more profound. It's a more profound worldview than anything else I've encountered by a by an immense amount. There's no comparison. And there's been lots of atheists who've watched my the the different series I've done on the Gospels or on on Genesis on Exodus who've begun to understand that there's far more to the biblical corpus than they had realized. that the version they've been presented with of Christian thinking is a shallow Marxist derived postenlightenment parody that bears no relationship whatsoever to the profoundity of the stories or the doctrine. That's it. You were saying that your deepening of your faith has made you has changed you. Yeah. How? Okay. This is awesome. I think it's changed everything. I think that I can truly I truly understand now what Jesus explained to us about having a veil over our eyes and that reflection of you know in the Old Testament because the people didn't have the spirit inside of them. They felt like they had to go to the church, right? They had to go to God in order to have the wisdom with them or they felt like they had to follow these certain rules, right? So they viewed their relationship with God as if it was just a set of rules. And that caused them to have a lack of, you know, closeness with God. And then when Jesus came and he was able to resolve that, we were able to get the Holy Spirit inside of us, then our veil was able to be lifted. And because of the Holy Spirit and the wisdom that he's given to us, now we're able to see things differently, understand things differently. the same way that the the word of God has been a able to give us this information, right? And so now I understand that in my own life, I can truly see that my old self was me in the Old Testament, right? I didn't have a relationship with God. I was far away from him. I did not have the spirit inside of me. So I had this veil and I saw things very differently. And now that I have a relationship with him, he's taken the veil off of my eyes. and things that I thought maybe were okay before, I just don't I genuinely do not see the same way. The way that um you know, my values lie, I feel so much more confident in where I stand because I know that at the end of the day, I rely on the word of God and not what I think might be true. Although I follow that all the time because I think we all do. But I now I have something to fall back on. I know that if I feel a certain way, I got to reposition myself. Okay, is am I leading myself astray or should I just like redirection myself to what God wants me to do in here? So, let me just redirection myself to his word, you know, and so that's How long have you been doing that? Probably in the last 3 years. Mhm. Yeah. Mhm. What's the biggest change as far as you're concerned for you? My biggest change? Yeah. What's changed for you most dramatically? H. That's an interesting question. What's better about you? Peace. I guess just my peace. You're pretty good at listening. Thank you. I appreciate that. That's a hell of a skill. A great partner. Thank you. Mhm. Yeah. I think she's built me up to be a great man. Well, thank you. But I don't know. I think listening has been Well, you know, I grew up my mom was my coach, was my figure skating coach, and so I trained really hard. Okay. So I I just want to pause quickly at this moment to emphasize what is basically being said here. She is um saying something different than what Dr. Peterson has been saying in that she's not describing Christianity as merely a worldview. Christianity is a worldview in the sense that it's all-encompassing that it has answers to the big questions of life. Where do we come from? What are we for? Where are we going? Um and so on. But this aspect that she's describing here is what actually separates Christianity from other worldviews. Because what she's saying is that God is not actually just a character inside of a book called the Bible. It's not um a story that we can sort of um see as a framework to live out of, but it's actually describing reality that God is outside of the pages of the Bible. that the stories that are told within the Bible um are depicting something that is available to modern people. There's a book that we're reading right now in the book club called True Spirituality. It's by Francis Schaefer. I'm going to read like four quotes from this that are really short to help drive the point home. He says the question before us is what the Christian life true spirituality really is and how it may be lived in the 20 well he said 20th century I'll say 21st century setting as the king of the earth and the mighty men of the earth are born in exactly the same way physically as the simplest man so the most intellectual person Dr. Peterson must become a Christian in exactly the same way as the simplest person. This is true for all men everywhere through all space and time. There are no exceptions. Jesus said a totally exclusive word. Quote, \"No man cometh unto the father but by me.\" The Bible's whole emphasis is that there must be no humanistic note added at any point to the accepting of the gospel. It is a supernatural event. I repeat, there is no way to begin the Christian life except through the door of spiritual birth any more than there is any other way to begin a physical life except through the door of physical birth. It's not just ideology. It's not just doctrine. The important thing after being born spiritually then is to live. There's a new birth and then there is a Christian life to be lived. And it's I love this point as well because so often I think Christians can think I was justified at a particular point in the past. I became a Christian. I was born again. Case closed. And and what a terrible understanding of scripture when again a birth is the beginning of a life to be lived. And so this I really think the the actual spiritual reality to the Christian life, not just the ideological reality, is the critical piece that I think and again not not really my place to judge, but it appears that is maybe missing in the life of Jordan Peterson. Um whether you agree or not, I'd be open to hear why in the comments. But in any case, I invite you today to pray for Jordan Peterson that this recent episode where um where George Jenko's wife here just told him the story of the difference that the Holy Spirit has made in her life. Maybe that could make an impact. Maybe it could um help that journey take place from the head to the heart, from the theoretical down into the real. And I pray today um and I ask you to pray with me for Dr. Jordan Peterson that Holy Spirit you would move in his life that you would continue to be bring people in front of him um and allow him to continue to have conversations like this one where he is actually able to begin to understand that there is there's two different things going on here. This Christian worldview and there is Christ slain and risen and coming again. Christ who is alive today and whose spirit is available to us today. And I just pray that your Holy Spirit that that he would understand this and that he actually would repent and believe that Jesus Christ is Lord. That he would um be born again, that he would receive the spirit and that he would become just a mighty and ferocious and bold proclaimer of the gospel message. That there would be no more tiptoeing around the tulips. And I even pray that in the future, how amazing would it be if he could go back onto Jubilee and that it would actually be one Christian um talking to 20 atheists, not just Jordan Peterson talking to 20 atheists, that that title would reflect a a reality and that he would be able to be used um to help other people understand the difference between mere thinking and ideology or to uh moralism, legalism. Um let all of that for him and for all of us give way to true spirituality. that we would know you, God, the one true God, in your son, Christ, Jesus, who you sent into this world, and that there would be um that there would be a revival in this land. We have so many problems going on. Every time I open up YouTube, I just ex am exposed to problems, and we know that you are the only true solution. You are the hope of nations. Um you are the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. And it is though it is that moral evil that seems to be at the root of every other problem. So um I just pray Lord I think anyone any believer listening to this I hope can pray with me. Um and we ask you to have your way Lord Jesus to bring revival to help people recognize their need for you and to fight against the enemy who is there to rob steal and destroy. We pray these things in Christ's name. Amen. If you enjoyed this conversation you might also enjoy the wisdom society. Join today. Support this channel. Invest in yourself. Grow in faith.

    "videoTitle": "RELEASE THE CCTV FOOTAGE!!!!",
    "videoUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0Ofg4GuH-A",
    "text": "Good morning, Everybody. United Kingdom, September 13th. Have you heard about that? If you want on these, you get them@nationware.co.uk I've got my baseball cap, UTK, everything's ready. So I want to say thank you. I want to say thank you to every single person who blindly defended me. Everyone who I watched, commentator after commentator. I was told by my solicitors, don't open your mouth. In the minute after this incident happened, I'm going to be honest, possibly one of the worst weeks of my life. I was worried, very worried. I thought I was being stitched up. I didn't think that they'd have the CCTV. I was detained yesterday on GBH618 and I was interviewed. And what my request would be right now is release the footage for the public to see, okay? That's what everyone needs to see the footage. Not that little clip. You need to see the footage. Don't listen to the accounts given in newspapers. You need to see the footage. Okay? What the footage will show you is I was walking home, another gentleman who wasn't, who come off the train, so. And he, he should be leaving St Pancras, saw me, followed me, confronted me, got here in my face for minutes. Yeah. I tried to get away from him. I tried everything. I tried telling him to leave me alone. I warned him so many times, please get away. Stop accosting me. Right? Leave me alone. He threatened me. He continually chased me, basically. Yeah. Until the point when we get to the top of the stairs, which is where some. There are some accounts of what happened, but no one's seen what happened previously. Thank God it's on cctv. You can see him harassing me in my face so much. Yeah. And you can see me trying to get away. So much. So at which point, the only time when I. And I, I didn't defend myself, even though I probably should have. When you watch the footage, I should have done it a minute before. I didn't defend myself until it become to a physical confrontation. Until he came at me. And as he comes at me, I defended myself. That's it. And that's what's on camera. He charges at me. Doesn't just come at me, he charges at me. Yeah. With his hands up. So listen, I wish him well. I do not blame that gentleman because he's been lied to by a fake news media. He's been told I'm Satan, he's been told I'm someone I'm not. So I don't blame him. Yeah. At the same time, I'M not a human punchback. I have to be able to walk streets. I think. Unfortunately I've come to the realization now I can't walk the streets because the worry and fear I've had for the last seven days. Let me get some other points clear. Yeah. I contacted the police, me straight away, okay. I told them exactly what I saw on the CCV yesterday, exactly what I told him. I was trying to get home, I was accosted, I was followed, I was threatened, I was harassed and then in the end I had to defend myself. That's exactly what the footage shows. Okay? Now I don't believe there's even a complainant in this case. So I've been arrested. I don't believe there's a complaint. I believe when the complainant sees the footage, he was drunk, he's gonna have woke up with a sore red. Right. But he was drunk as well. But I think when he sees the footage. I don't believe there's complaining in this case, but I'm not. I can't go into other details due to my bail conditions, but I've been released on bail till 2nd September, as I said. Thank you. Because all the people who blindly defended me, you know who I am, you know, I just don't go around punching people. Come on, man. In fact, I take a lot of criticism, I take a lot of abuse. I don't react with them and react with them when it's last resort and I need to defend myself because I'm not going to be the man laying on the floor. That's not going to be me. And unfortunately some people would only be happy if it's me with a forensic tent. Yeah. And it wasn't okay. And just to clear something up for the media, the media said I went on the run. So I produced to the police, which let me get sound clear. I rang the police straight away. I contacted the police straight away. Yeah, my solicitors contacted them at six o' clock the next morning. We made them aware of where I was, made them aware of the date I was coming home already. Now, just so you know, I've showed evidence to the police that my accommodation, everything was booked before this incident. So before this incident happened, I had a trip planned. Fact. If I had tried to escape the country like the media have told you, if I went on the run like the media told you, I wouldn't now have my passport, would I? That's not. I don't have a bail condition to stay in the country. I don't have any of those bail conditions. So also the police. What's very strange for me is when I landed at Lulu, you may have seen the scenes of all the police cars, of all the police. It's me that told them I arranged to come back. I was flying into Manchester. I changed my flight for them, so I don't know why they made that big scene. And you get the video of all those police wagons arresting me when I was coming back for an interview that I planned from the minute it happened. I'd been in cooperation with the police. There was no running away. There never has been. Yeah, I willingly come back, but I was coming back when I was coming back anyway. So anyway, this is a thank you from me. September 13th is going full ahead. Full scene ahead. It's gonna be bigger than ever. Self defense is the defense. Yeah. It's not crime. If someone comes up and wants to accost me, confront me and attempt to attack me, I'm within my rights to defend myself. I wish I didn't have to. I really wish I didn't have to. I really wish that man well. And I hope he gets better and I hope he makes a full recovery. And I didn't want what happened that day to happen. I just wanted to go home. And I've had the worst week, as I'm sure his family have. Yeah, maybe it's been a lesson for him. It's been a lesson for me. I can't walk the streets of this country on my own. And unfortunately, that's what I walk everywhere I'm in London, Luton, everywhere I go. I just go on my own, I think. So what? Oh, I'll deal with it. But I shouldn't have to deal with it. And unfortunately now realize that there's too much of a risk there. It's too much of a risk for me. I can do nothing wrong but still be seen to do something wrong. Look at the media this week, man. Look at what they've portrayed and how it's been portrayed in forensic. Forensic tents. Blood transfusion. There was no blood transfusion. All the newspaper sound as a blood transfusion. It's all. He weren't 64. It's a lie. They lied about his age. Everything a lie. But thank you, everyone. Okay. After seeing the cctv, I know there's not a jury in the world would convict me of that. So my request to the Metro One police force is release the footage, Let the public see. Okay? Too much bullshit's been happening this week for the last seven days. I've had to watch listen to it and read it, okay? I know what happened that day. And I know the man I am. And every one of you know the man I am. I'm not coward, okay? I'm not a coward. I don't just provoke reactions. I don't provoke trouble. And I don't just throw punches willy nilly either. That's only at last resort as defense. So thank you, everyone. Yeah. Utk. Come on. September 13th. Nationware.co.uk get yours right, let's go.",

    "text": "The Zionist bruh. You what? The Zionist bruh. Do you even know what a Zionist is? Yes. Tell me. A Jewish person. So you're just saying f Jewish people? Basically every single one of them. Basically. Huh. You're Muslim? You understand Arabic? Yeah. Yeah. How about this? Where are you from? I'm Syrian. Turkish. Syrian. Turkey. That explains the hate. You all got a lot of hate. No, I don't. I don't hate Jews. I'm joking. So this one thing that blows my mind with Syrians. Yeah. Is they obsess over the war between Israel and Gaza. No. No. I couldn't give a Fuck. One year, 130,000 dead in 2014, and the world didn't even notice in Syria. Assad Daesh. They can kill as many as they want and nobody cared. But if Israel sneezes, y' all come out, protest and screaming, death to Yahud. Who? Syrians. Not Syrians, but the Ummah. The Ummah? The Muslims. Yeah. That's because you are trying to destroy the most sacred place. No, second most sacred place. But do you know why Masjid Al Aqsa is holy to you guys? Yeah. Because the Messiah is gonna go there. So where does Quds get its name from? Huh? Al Quds. Where does it get its name from? Oh, Al Q. Yeah. Do you know what the bait Al Maktis was? It was our temple. It's our holiest site. Oh, that's crazy. Anyway. What? You Muslim or Jewish? Yahude, of course. It's all right. You know what I mean? It's not that deep. If we can live in the same world together, then it's no problem, inshallah. You get me? You'll just need to calm down. Let us have our one country. You have your like. No, you don't just need to let Palestine at least be, bro. But what does that mean? Let it be like you are trying to take over a whole country? Well, you say that belongs to you? Yeah. Wait. Allah subhanahu wa ta' ala says it belongs to us. Your God said it belongs to you. Our God? You worship Allah. I worship Allah. The God of Ibrahim Isa. Yeah. Then it's the same God, bro. Okay, but still we don't believe in the same thing, Abhit. Do you believe Musa Rasulallah? I believe in the prophets. Yes, I believe in the prophets. But you're trying to say that. It's like saying, how do I explain this? Like the whole world belongs to us just because our God owns it. It don't make sense. Mecca and Medina belongs to you. No, I mean that is a Muslim area. Yeah, but it used to be Jewish habibi. Yeah, you kicked us all out. You kicked us out and said it's ours now, just like in Israel. No, it's because back then there were no like. Basically, yeah, you know, I mean religions and that. There were no religions back then. No, you don't believe the rock. We believed in rocks. We were worshiping Allah. Subhana wa ta'. Ala. When you're one. Pagans. When they were. No, no, not like that. You lot were basically praying to whoever was the highest on the mountain chain, you get me? And I was saying, fam, you've got it wrong. You've got it badly wrong. Bow down to your king and pray to him. We don't pray to the king. We only pray. There's only one entity we bow down to and that's Allah. Subhanahu wa ta'. Ala. We bow to no man. Type. Type. Come on. I think that's the only thing that we actually singing, you know, I mean, look, you took our profits. Profits. Hold the up. Was that wood? Was it that wood? D? Yeah, it's maybe my pronunciation. That's just yours. That's your prophets. No, he's. He. I mean he was. Yah. He was from Al Yahud. Exactly. But that's not our prophet, is it then? No, no, D is one of your prophet. That's that for Allah. I feel like Ali Dawah here giving you dawah. Instead of calling me Akhiya bro, you can just call me Sheikh. Sheikh Jew. The man knows the Hadith. This man's on his dean. You other boys failed the Islam test. You don't say walaikum salam to you can't wish peace upon a Jew. I stagfu Allah. You don't say it to our Ken. His camera. What is your camera? It's a Sony A6 500. It's to catch all the anti Semites in high definition. Yeah, but I can. I can see every, like, every bit. Yeah, you have to follow the example of Muhammad. So now he gets a point in the Islam test. He's more patient, he's chill, he's slow to anger. Why are we jumping to conflict? Exactly. We need this man in the United Nations Bani Israel and the Ummah can get on once again. We need to give this man a seat at the un. So he gets two points now and the man with his mouth open. You're black. You're black. No point for you, brother. The first person to meet the Azad was a black man in front of a hobbit. Exactly. Give me my points, give me my points. You know, I'll give you an extra point because in that Jewish tradition the, the wife of Musa sallallahu alaihi wasallam was also a black woman. So I don't know if this in the Islamic tradition, but that's in our tradition. Any other prophet, that's not Muhammad, you say, I know, but you guys make mistakes and that's okay because you're on taqeed, you're on La ilaha illa Allah. So we'll forgive you for not giving Musa the appropriate, appropriate respect. So Musa is the only nabi, the only prophet who spoke with Allah Subhanahu wa ta' ala face to face in the Jewish tradition or directly. It wasn't for Jibreel, it wasn't through a messenger, through like an angel. And for us he's clearly the highest prophet, which is why we follow his Sharia and we follow his Sunnah and we give him an appropriate level of respect, the highest honor we can. The Ummah make a mistake and that's fine. They give Muhammad more respect than they give to Musa. But they're still on the deen, they're still on tawhid. So we forgive them. We forgive you guys. You don't get it, all right? But you're close. You're doing better than other religions. But that's according to your religion. That's according to Allah. Subhanahu wa ta'. Ala. What? That Musa should get more respect than Muhammad. Musa is the highest prophet that's ever been, which is why he didn't need an intermediary. But what I would say is you'll need a chill. When you see Jews, you get so excited and so animated. I'm not, I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to like attached to you, you know. Yeah, I just want to speak. Yeah, no, no, respect, respect that the difference between Jews and Zionists, like so. But this is the thing and I'm one of the Zionists. I'm the, I'm the ones you think the bad guys. I don't mind the tubular Zionist. That's different. I'll still like try to be calm about it. But so, so what, what is that? What is a Zionist? A Zionist? It's more. Because when you think of like Judaism you think, you think more of like a nationality, more of like, how do you say? It's a political thing, political stand. But. Well, I'm not going to read the Definition. This is this definition. I'll give you the definition. You don't need to go to chef Google a Zionist? Is anyone that supports the state of the Jews having their own state in the land of Israel political? But all Jews pray for that three times a day. When we eat food, when we go to the synagogue, we're praying to return and rebuild Jerusalem. It's a central tenet of the faith of Judaism. And even the guys you think are anti Zionist like that you see on the protests with the sidekills and the black hats, they're also Zionists. They're just not Zionists yet. They believe it should be in a few years time. You can't separate Zion. The word Zion appears over 100 times in the in the Jewish Bible. And I'll go on further. The word Israel appears 47 times in the Quran. Do you know how many times the word Palestine appears? I don't know. Zero. Muslims get things mixed up. Allah subhanahu wa ta Allah wants Al Yehud in the the land of Barak. The the land of Israel. He wants us there. It was, it says in the Quran he's returned us there as prophesied. He's crushed all of our enemies that have come to take it from us. Even though we were much weaker at the beginning than the Muslim armies that marched on us. It's the will of Allah Subhanahu wa ta' ala that Al Yehuda in Israel today, it's in the Quran, it's in the Torah and it's in the it's in the world now. If Allah didn't want us there, he would kick us out. But Alhamdulillah, I wake up every morning in Al Qut in Yerushalayim and thank Allah that I'm here and that he preserves me and my family in this land. Thousand years ago dude, still with Sheikh Google. I'm on LinkedIn actually Israel was promised thousand years ago, had the most amount of prophets sent to them. Still never embraced Islam. I just want to know why. So I be I don't want to take Muslims out of Islam because I think the central message there's things in Islam I disagree with otherwise I'd be Muslim. But I think the message, central message of La Ilaha Il Allah is a beautiful message and Muslims have carried that to the four corners of the earth and jazakallahu for that. They deserve respect for doing that. From a personal perspective, why I have embraced Islam, why the Al Yehud haven't is we don't believe Allah Subhanahu wa ta' ala makes mistakes. And we don't believe that he'd allow his book to get corrupted as it says in the Quran, even. And so when he sends the Tawrat to Bani Israel by the Nabi Musa, we don't believe that that eternal message is cancelled. We believe that Bani Israel are bound to this. We don't care about anything else. In terms of the religion, this message was given to Musa and we followed it since the time of Musa. We followed the Sharia and the Sunnah of Musa from that time. And there are things in the Quran that would take Al Yahud away from that Sharia. There are contradictions between the two faiths. So while I don't want to take you out of your religion, I don't want to affect your iman from a Jewish perspective. We cannot follow the Quran because of those contradictions with what we believe we're commanded to follow. I'll give you a lot of. It can just be very minute technical laws, but they're very real. So we care about the food we eat. We have to. It's not called halal, obviously, it's called kosher, but it's much, much stricter than, than halal. And one of the laws is when we eat food from the sea, the Torah is explicit. It must have fins and scales. So we can't eat crabs and shellfish and octopus. And the Hanafi, they hold like us, they follow what Al Yahud follow, they also don't. But the actual Quran itself says everything in the sea is lawful. Exactly. And so that would be a contradiction if the Quran's telling me that I can eat an octopus and the Torah saying it's Jahannam if I do as Bani Israel, I have to choose a text. And so that's why Muslims don't follow the Torah. They follow the Quran because the Quran is obviously the last book that the seal of. Like, I don't know how to explain it. I don't know. So I understand that. I'm very familiar with most of the arguments for why you should be Muslim. And I'm happy with you being Muslim, just not me being Muslim. I wake up every morning and say I'm following the Sharia of Musa. But hey, bro, nice meeting you, man. Yeah, likewise, guys. May Allah Subhanahu wa ta' ala guide us all to this right path.",
