    "text": "[00:00.1] [Applause] [00:00.3] I'm trying to look and see if I can see [00:01.6] that finger but whatever happens to Y [00:03.6] and whatever has happened we know she [00:05.6] ain't going to give up out there she's [00:07.2] going to give it everything yeah a look [00:08.7] of concern on the coach's face you have [00:10.6] to say and we don't know what happened [00:12.6] we expect y picked up some sort of [00:14.9] finger injury just to explain in case [00:16.6] you didn't catch that boulder around [00:18.0] there a bit of a Grimace after Boulder [00:19.5] too and we don't know at what point we [00:21.1] don't have any more information from you [00:23.5] uh for you but what y needs to do if she [00:26.0] wants to take the top spot is hold 72 [00:29.4] points and you can see that there you [00:30.6] can see just how high she's got these [00:32.7] women have given her a run for her money [00:36.0] because they've not handed it to her by [00:37.6] any means she's going to have to fight [00:39.0] if she wants a second Olympic medal and [00:41.2] she wants gold she's going to have to [00:42.5] have the climb of her life that was such [00:44.2] a great performance from Jesse but now [00:46.5] all eyes on y yeah so she's underway [00:50.1] now finger she won't show any pain if [00:53.7] she's feeling it she's a competitor she [00:56.5] understands you need to keep these [00:57.6] things in Fight Hard Out On The Wall out [01:00.0] with the right hand she's climbing [01:01.2] quickly at the [01:02.6] moment coming into this you know she's [01:05.4] she is the greatest athlete of all time [01:07.4] and in our Sport and arguably across [01:10.0] sport if you look at certain statistics [01:12.1] and she said on social that she is [01:13.7] another step closer and she just left it [01:16.2] there she didn't see anything else [01:18.2] recently there's been some interviews [01:19.8] with her that have come out unfiltered [01:21.6] interviews and it's great to get a bit [01:24.2] more insight into someone who doesn't [01:25.7] tend to be that open she doesn't do that [01:28.1] that much media and you know she done so [01:30.4] much for our sport she's really [01:31.8] passionate she really cares about the [01:33.2] progress of it too and to be as good as [01:35.3] she is and to do as much as she does for [01:37.2] the positive progression of the sport [01:39.2] it's just a testament to who she is as a [01:41.0] human being not just an athlete so she's [01:43.9] into this ShakeOut position no sign of [01:46.4] this finger injury [01:48.4] yet Brooke talking there to Jesse about [01:51.7] the route itself remember Brook [01:53.6] guaranteed a silver medal at least here [01:56.7] again you're looking down at that skin [01:58.7] he's chalking up the skin her fingers [02:00.4] since she looks right towards the [02:01.9] Traverse she goes all the way from the [02:03.4] left hand side of the wall all the way [02:04.8] to the right with that 30 point score [02:07.2] beckons yeah taking a longer pause there [02:11.2] than we're used to seeing y take but [02:13.7] that doesn't suggest very much you know [02:15.6] the enormity of this pressure and this [02:18.6] moment for her is impossible to describe [02:22.0] and she's going to be using everything [02:24.0] that she can pulling on the breadth of [02:26.2] experience you know all of those medals [02:28.0] she's got to her name to compose herself [02:30.2] and focus as she moves through this [02:32.6] climb yeah she's not 100% Yan yet from [02:36.6] what I can [02:37.7] see she's maybe just having to work a [02:40.3] little harder yeah but you can't see [02:43.9] much in the way of her having to [02:45.2] struggle yet that's for sure you know [02:46.7] her arms are straight her body movements [02:48.7] are smooth she's looking relaxed her [02:51.0] head's not looking around her shoulders [02:52.6] are nice and low she does look pretty [02:54.8] calm and collected to me all right well [02:56.8] she's into the next scoring place now [02:58.9] three points per hole and this has moved [03:01.2] straight up into fifth place creeping [03:03.8] towards the [03:05.2] medals up with the right hand little bit [03:08.1] of an adjustment and then bumps into [03:10.1] this left side [03:11.4] po high heel and another chance to chalk [03:14.4] up have a shake we talk about the [03:16.4] pressure piled on y more pressure comes [03:19.1] from herself than she feels from anyone [03:21.0] else and she has been at the top of the [03:23.4] sport for what feels like forever and [03:24.8] she's only 25 years old and I think it's [03:29.4] really impressive for someone to [03:31.1] dominate for so long and she said that's [03:32.9] what inspires her seeing athletes stay [03:34.8] at the top of their game for so long [03:36.4] coach looking a lot more convinced and a [03:39.2] lot happier and I think he'll have been [03:40.8] nervous about seeing what state she was [03:42.6] in how she was climbing where her flow [03:44.8] was but she's looking flowy to me yeah [03:47.6] she is she's guaranteed a medal now so [03:49.4] that's bronze for yya she won't be [03:51.8] satisfied with that though she also [03:53.6] doesn't know dropping down as well to [03:55.4] rest you say she won't be satisfied [03:57.0] she's got no idea that she's got a medal [03:59.0] right now and you know she's not here [04:00.2] for a bronze medal she's not here for a [04:01.6] silver medal she said herself she's here [04:03.8] for a gold medal she wants a second one [04:06.4] and yes she's dropping down not [04:08.0] something we see y do but she is looking [04:10.3] move as she moves through the Section [04:11.7] and I think we could see a great display [04:13.8] from y on this route and she didn't get [04:15.6] to show her best self in Boulder but she [04:19.0] looked like she was struggling with that [04:21.0] clip there didn't she yeah she did well [04:22.8] that's silver so she's guaranteed silver [04:25.1] now just bronze gold to come there is [04:27.8] that first place move she gets that hand [04:30.2] she does it oh it's not it it's not she [04:32.8] didn't secure it she reaches for the [04:34.4] clip and now she gets it she shifts her [04:36.6] away brings her foot up the crowd are [04:38.0] going wild I don't think she'll quite [04:39.8] know she'll want to finish this round on [04:41.5] the top Brook rabitu cheering and [04:43.1] screaming she knows now she's got a [04:44.8] silver medal can Yan make the dream [04:47.7] happen and finish this round with a top [04:50.6] I don't think anyone really cares [04:52.0] because she is the gold medalist she's [04:53.5] done it again despite everything she's [04:55.2] faced Yan gambra is your gold medalist [04:58.7] yeah Yan will take Victory here Brooks [05:00.8] celebrating with her is guaranteed that [05:02.6] silver medal now we know our finals and [05:05.0] Y look at that emotion as she comes down [05:08.0] she had to dig so so deep I think deeper [05:10.6] than we know out there on the wall and [05:13.7] another goal that's the second time she [05:15.8] is a two-time Olympic [05:18.9] champion she isn't the best because it's [05:22.4] given to her she works so hard she [05:25.1] fights so hard she had to push to come [05:27.8] back after Tokyo you know that dip that [05:30.4] she felt she didn't know she'd everever [05:31.8] want to climb again she didn't know she [05:33.1] ever could because it's the enormity of [05:35.3] winning the Tokyo games but she is now a [05:37.8] two-time Olympic gold medalist no one [05:40.8] else in our sport can say that Yan G BR [05:43.3] soak it in hi I'm Ellie Simmons [05:46.3] subscribe
