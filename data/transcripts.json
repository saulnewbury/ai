    "text": "The Zionist bruh. You what? The Zionist bruh. Do you even know what a Zionist is? Yes. Tell me. A Jewish person. So you're just saying f Jewish people? Basically every single one of them. Basically. Huh. You're Muslim? You understand Arabic? Yeah. Yeah. How about this? Where are you from? I'm Syrian. Turkish. Syrian. Turkey. That explains the hate. You all got a lot of hate. No, I don't. I don't hate Jews. I'm joking. So this one thing that blows my mind with Syrians. Yeah. Is they obsess over the war between Israel and Gaza. No. No. I couldn't give a Fuck. One year, 130,000 dead in 2014, and the world didn't even notice in Syria. Assad Daesh. They can kill as many as they want and nobody cared. But if Israel sneezes, y' all come out, protest and screaming, death to Yahud. Who? Syrians. Not Syrians, but the Ummah. The Ummah? The Muslims. Yeah. That's because you are trying to destroy the most sacred place. No, second most sacred place. But do you know why Masjid Al Aqsa is holy to you guys? Yeah. Because the Messiah is gonna go there. So where does Quds get its name from? Huh? Al Quds. Where does it get its name from? Oh, Al Q. Yeah. Do you know what the bait Al Maktis was? It was our temple. It's our holiest site. Oh, that's crazy. Anyway. What? You Muslim or Jewish? Yahude, of course. It's all right. You know what I mean? It's not that deep. If we can live in the same world together, then it's no problem, inshallah. You get me? You'll just need to calm down. Let us have our one country. You have your like. No, you don't just need to let Palestine at least be, bro. But what does that mean? Let it be like you are trying to take over a whole country? Well, you say that belongs to you? Yeah. Wait. Allah subhanahu wa ta' ala says it belongs to us. Your God said it belongs to you. Our God? You worship Allah. I worship Allah. The God of Ibrahim Isa. Yeah. Then it's the same God, bro. Okay, but still we don't believe in the same thing, Abhit. Do you believe Musa Rasulallah? I believe in the prophets. Yes, I believe in the prophets. But you're trying to say that. It's like saying, how do I explain this? Like the whole world belongs to us just because our God owns it. It don't make sense. Mecca and Medina belongs to you. No, I mean that is a Muslim area. Yeah, but it used to be Jewish habibi. Yeah, you kicked us all out. You kicked us out and said it's ours now, just like in Israel. No, it's because back then there were no like. Basically, yeah, you know, I mean religions and that. There were no religions back then. No, you don't believe the rock. We believed in rocks. We were worshiping Allah. Subhana wa ta'. Ala. When you're one. Pagans. When they were. No, no, not like that. You lot were basically praying to whoever was the highest on the mountain chain, you get me? And I was saying, fam, you've got it wrong. You've got it badly wrong. Bow down to your king and pray to him. We don't pray to the king. We only pray. There's only one entity we bow down to and that's Allah. Subhanahu wa ta'. Ala. We bow to no man. Type. Type. Come on. I think that's the only thing that we actually singing, you know, I mean, look, you took our profits. Profits. Hold the up. Was that wood? Was it that wood? D? Yeah, it's maybe my pronunciation. That's just yours. That's your prophets. No, he's. He. I mean he was. Yah. He was from Al Yahud. Exactly. But that's not our prophet, is it then? No, no, D is one of your prophet. That's that for Allah. I feel like Ali Dawah here giving you dawah. Instead of calling me Akhiya bro, you can just call me Sheikh. Sheikh Jew. The man knows the Hadith. This man's on his dean. You other boys failed the Islam test. You don't say walaikum salam to you can't wish peace upon a Jew. I stagfu Allah. You don't say it to our Ken. His camera. What is your camera? It's a Sony A6 500. It's to catch all the anti Semites in high definition. Yeah, but I can. I can see every, like, every bit. Yeah, you have to follow the example of Muhammad. So now he gets a point in the Islam test. He's more patient, he's chill, he's slow to anger. Why are we jumping to conflict? Exactly. We need this man in the United Nations Bani Israel and the Ummah can get on once again. We need to give this man a seat at the un. So he gets two points now and the man with his mouth open. You're black. You're black. No point for you, brother. The first person to meet the Azad was a black man in front of a hobbit. Exactly. Give me my points, give me my points. You know, I'll give you an extra point because in that Jewish tradition the, the wife of Musa sallallahu alaihi wasallam was also a black woman. So I don't know if this in the Islamic tradition, but that's in our tradition. Any other prophet, that's not Muhammad, you say, I know, but you guys make mistakes and that's okay because you're on taqeed, you're on La ilaha illa Allah. So we'll forgive you for not giving Musa the appropriate, appropriate respect. So Musa is the only nabi, the only prophet who spoke with Allah Subhanahu wa ta' ala face to face in the Jewish tradition or directly. It wasn't for Jibreel, it wasn't through a messenger, through like an angel. And for us he's clearly the highest prophet, which is why we follow his Sharia and we follow his Sunnah and we give him an appropriate level of respect, the highest honor we can. The Ummah make a mistake and that's fine. They give Muhammad more respect than they give to Musa. But they're still on the deen, they're still on tawhid. So we forgive them. We forgive you guys. You don't get it, all right? But you're close. You're doing better than other religions. But that's according to your religion. That's according to Allah. Subhanahu wa ta'. Ala. What? That Musa should get more respect than Muhammad. Musa is the highest prophet that's ever been, which is why he didn't need an intermediary. But what I would say is you'll need a chill. When you see Jews, you get so excited and so animated. I'm not, I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to like attached to you, you know. Yeah, I just want to speak. Yeah, no, no, respect, respect that the difference between Jews and Zionists, like so. But this is the thing and I'm one of the Zionists. I'm the, I'm the ones you think the bad guys. I don't mind the tubular Zionist. That's different. I'll still like try to be calm about it. But so, so what, what is that? What is a Zionist? A Zionist? It's more. Because when you think of like Judaism you think, you think more of like a nationality, more of like, how do you say? It's a political thing, political stand. But. Well, I'm not going to read the Definition. This is this definition. I'll give you the definition. You don't need to go to chef Google a Zionist? Is anyone that supports the state of the Jews having their own state in the land of Israel political? But all Jews pray for that three times a day. When we eat food, when we go to the synagogue, we're praying to return and rebuild Jerusalem. It's a central tenet of the faith of Judaism. And even the guys you think are anti Zionist like that you see on the protests with the sidekills and the black hats, they're also Zionists. They're just not Zionists yet. They believe it should be in a few years time. You can't separate Zion. The word Zion appears over 100 times in the in the Jewish Bible. And I'll go on further. The word Israel appears 47 times in the Quran. Do you know how many times the word Palestine appears? I don't know. Zero. Muslims get things mixed up. Allah subhanahu wa ta Allah wants Al Yehud in the the land of Barak. The the land of Israel. He wants us there. It was, it says in the Quran he's returned us there as prophesied. He's crushed all of our enemies that have come to take it from us. Even though we were much weaker at the beginning than the Muslim armies that marched on us. It's the will of Allah Subhanahu wa ta' ala that Al Yehuda in Israel today, it's in the Quran, it's in the Torah and it's in the it's in the world now. If Allah didn't want us there, he would kick us out. But Alhamdulillah, I wake up every morning in Al Qut in Yerushalayim and thank Allah that I'm here and that he preserves me and my family in this land. Thousand years ago dude, still with Sheikh Google. I'm on LinkedIn actually Israel was promised thousand years ago, had the most amount of prophets sent to them. Still never embraced Islam. I just want to know why. So I be I don't want to take Muslims out of Islam because I think the central message there's things in Islam I disagree with otherwise I'd be Muslim. But I think the message, central message of La Ilaha Il Allah is a beautiful message and Muslims have carried that to the four corners of the earth and jazakallahu for that. They deserve respect for doing that. From a personal perspective, why I have embraced Islam, why the Al Yehud haven't is we don't believe Allah Subhanahu wa ta' ala makes mistakes. And we don't believe that he'd allow his book to get corrupted as it says in the Quran, even. And so when he sends the Tawrat to Bani Israel by the Nabi Musa, we don't believe that that eternal message is cancelled. We believe that Bani Israel are bound to this. We don't care about anything else. In terms of the religion, this message was given to Musa and we followed it since the time of Musa. We followed the Sharia and the Sunnah of Musa from that time. And there are things in the Quran that would take Al Yahud away from that Sharia. There are contradictions between the two faiths. So while I don't want to take you out of your religion, I don't want to affect your iman from a Jewish perspective. We cannot follow the Quran because of those contradictions with what we believe we're commanded to follow. I'll give you a lot of. It can just be very minute technical laws, but they're very real. So we care about the food we eat. We have to. It's not called halal, obviously, it's called kosher, but it's much, much stricter than, than halal. And one of the laws is when we eat food from the sea, the Torah is explicit. It must have fins and scales. So we can't eat crabs and shellfish and octopus. And the Hanafi, they hold like us, they follow what Al Yahud follow, they also don't. But the actual Quran itself says everything in the sea is lawful. Exactly. And so that would be a contradiction if the Quran's telling me that I can eat an octopus and the Torah saying it's Jahannam if I do as Bani Israel, I have to choose a text. And so that's why Muslims don't follow the Torah. They follow the Quran because the Quran is obviously the last book that the seal of. Like, I don't know how to explain it. I don't know. So I understand that. I'm very familiar with most of the arguments for why you should be Muslim. And I'm happy with you being Muslim, just not me being Muslim. I wake up every morning and say I'm following the Sharia of Musa. But hey, bro, nice meeting you, man. Yeah, likewise, guys. May Allah Subhanahu wa ta' ala guide us all to this right path.",
